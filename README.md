<!-- badges: end -->

Contains lecture notes for a course in Data Science. This course assumes
that you have a mastery of most of the `{tidyverse}` tools as described
in [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). The goals of this
class are to

1.  Expand a student’s toolbox for collaboration and project management
    (`git`, `R projects`).
2.  Expand a student’s presentation abilities (R shiny).
3.  Improve a student’s basic R programming skills (data types, function
    creation, basic programming tasks).
4.  Expose students to common data programming languages beyond R (SQL,
    python).
