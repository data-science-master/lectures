- [Interactive Cheat Sheet](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3575086/the-ultimate-r-datatable-cheat-sheet.html)

# Data Frames and Motivation

- Big data: Can't read data into memory. Need to do distributed computing (like [Spark](https://therinspark.com/intro.html)).

- Biggish data: Can read data into memory, but it's very slow to manipulate it.

- The data.table package helps you with biggish data.

- `data.frame`s are a base R class. We've learned about them [before](https://dcgerard.github.io/stat_412_612/lectures/01_intro/01_data_frames.pdf).

- There are many competitors to `data.frame`s: [`tibble`s](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/), [`DataFrame`s](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/S4Vectors.html) (from Bioconductor), and [`data.table`s](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki).

- Julia (another statistical programming language) has its own [`DataFrames`](https://juliadata.github.io/DataFrames.jl/stable/) class. Python's data frames package is called [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

- `data.table` is the fastest: <https://h2oai.github.io/db-benchmark/>.

- So why did we learn the tidyverse? 
    - It's easier to read. This is important if you are sharing code, or 
      if you are looking at your code 6 months after you write it
      (this is a *very* controversial opinion and Matt Dowle would disagree
      with this).
    - For datasets with fewer than, like, one million observations, it works 
      fast enough.

# Syntax

## Reading in and Printing Data

- Load the data.table package and (to compare) the tidyverse into R:
    ```{r, message = FALSE}
    library(tidyverse)
    library(data.table)
    ```
    
- We'll demonstrate most methods with the data from "NYC-flights14" dataset from
  the data.table package vignettes. I've posted it on my own webpage:
  <https://data-science-master.github.io/lectures/data/flights14.csv>.
  
- Read in data with `fread()` (for "file read"). It accepts all delimiters, 
  which you (optionally) specify with the `sep` argument. The default is to
  guess the delimiter.
  
    ```{r}
    flights <- fread("../data/flights14.csv")
    ```
    
- `fread()` will return a `data.table` object.

    ```{r}
    class(flights)
    ```
    
- Use `fwrite()` to write a `data.table` object to a file.

- Compare to `read_csv()` in the tidyverse.

    ```{r, message=FALSE}
    flights_tib <- read_csv("../data/flights14.csv")
    ```
    
- `read_csv()` will return a tibble.

    ```{r}
    class(flights_tib)
    ```

- `tibble`s and `data.table`s both print better than `data.frame`s.
    
    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    flights
    flights_tib
    ```
    
- You usually use the base function `str()` (for "**str**ucture") to look at 
  the `data.table` entries.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ## data.table way
    str(flights)
    
    ## Similar tidyverse way
    glimpse(flights_tib)
    ```

- You can use `as.data.table()` to convert a `tibble` or a `data.frame` into 
  a `data.table`. But there is rarely a time when you'd do this, since
  you use data.table for large datasets that you read in with `fread()`.
  
    ```{r}
    temp_dt <- as.data.table(flights_tib)
    class(temp_dt)
    ```

## Filtering/Arranging Rows (Observations)

- Just like in the tidyverse, we use logicals to filter based on rows. The
  syntax for this is to place the logicals inside a bracket. Let's find all
  flights that left JFK and arrived at LAX.
  
    ```{r, results = "hide"}
    ## data.table way
    flights[origin == "JFK" & dest == "LAX"]
    
    ## equivalent tidyverse way
    flights_tib %>%
      filter(origin == "JFK", dest == "LAX")
    ```
    
- To get a specific row, insert a number into the brackets.

    ```{r, results = "hide"}
    ## data.table way
    flights[c(1, 3, 207)]
    
    ## equivalent tidyverse way
    flights_tib %>%
      slice(1, 3, 207)
    ```
    
- Reorder rows by using the `order()` function inside the brackets. Let's
  reorder the rows alphabetically by origin, and break ties in reverse
  alphabetical order by destination.

    ```{r, results = "hide"}
    ## data.table way
    flights[order(origin, -dest)]

    ## equivalent tidyverse way    
    flights_tib %>%
      arrange(origin, desc(dest))
    ```

- **Exercise**: Use both data.table and the tidyverse to select all 
  flights from EWR and LGA, and arrange the flights in decreasing order of
  departure delay.
  
    ```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
    ## data.table way
    fl1 <- flights[origin == "EWR" | origin == "LGA"]
    fl1[order(-dep_delay)]
    
    ## equivalent tidyverse way
    flights_tib %>%
      filter(origin == "EWR" | origin == "LGA") %>%
      arrange(desc(dep_delay))
    ```

## Selecting Columns (Variables)

- To select a variable (a column), you also use bracket notation, but you
  place a comma before you select the columns. This idea is that you are
  selecting all rows (empty space before comma).
  
- There are lots of ways to select columns that keeps the new object a 
  `data.table`.
    
- **List method**: Use the `.()` function (which is an alias for `list()`).

    ```{r, results = "hide"}
    ## data.table way
    flights[, .(origin, dest)]
    
    ## Or
    flights[, list(origin, dest)]
    
    ## equivalent tidyverse way
    flights_tib %>%
      select(origin, dest)
    ```
    
- **Character Vector Method**: Use `c()` with their character names
    ```{r, results = "hide"}
    flights[, c("origin", "dest")]
    ```
    
- **Range Method**: Use `:` to select variables within a range of columns.

    ```{r, results = "hide"}
    flights[, origin:dest]
    ```
    
- **Prespecify Method**: Define variables to keep outside of the `data.table`, then
  use `with = FALSE`. This option makes data.table not think that `keep_vec`
  is a varible in the `data.table`.
  
    ```{r, results = "hide"}
    keep_vec <- c("origin", "dest")
    flights[, keep_vec, with = FALSE]
    ```
  
- To remove a column using the range or character methods, place a `!` before the columns to remove
  
    ```{r, results = "hide"}
    flights[, !c("year", "month")]
    flights[, !(year:month)]
    ```
    
- To remove a column using the list method, assign that variable to be `NULL` using modify by reference (see below). If you run the below code, you'll need to reload the `flights` data to get back `year` and `month`.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    flights[, c("year", "month") := .(NULL, NULL)]
    ```
    
- **Exercise**: Use data.table to select the `year`, `month`, `day`, and `hour` 
  columns.
  
    ```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
    flights[, .(year, month, day, hour)]
    ```
    
    
- Unlike the tidyverse, you filter rows and select columns in one call
  rather than using two separate functions. 
  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ## data.table way
    flights[origin == "JFK" & dest == "LAX", .(year, month, day, hour)]
    
    ## equivalent tidyverse way
    flights_tib %>%
      filter(origin == "JFK", dest == "LAX") %>%
      select(year, month, day, hour)
    ```
    
- **Exercise**: Use data.table to print out just the departure delays from JFK.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    flights[origin == "JFK", .(dep_delay)]
    ```

## Creating New Variables (Mutate)

- The **fastest** way to create and remove variables in a `data.table` is by 
  [reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#Call_by_reference), 
  where we **modify** the `data.table`, we don't create a new `data.table`.
  
- Use `:=` to modify a data.table by reference. You put the variable names
  (as a character vector) to the left of `:=`. You put the new variables
  (as a list) to the right of `:=`.
  
    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    ## data.table way
    flights[, c("gain") := .(dep_delay - arr_delay)]
    flights

    ## equivalent tidyverse way    
    flights_tib %>%
      mutate(gain = dep_delay - arr_delay) ->
      flights_tib
    flights_tib
    ```
  
- Quickly remove a column by setting that variable to NULL.

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    ## data.table way
    flights[, c("gain") := .(NULL)]
    flights
    
    ## equivalent tidyverse way
    flights_tib %>%
      select(-gain) ->
      flights_tib
    flights_tib
    ```
    
- Add multiple variables by separating them with columns.

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    flights[, c("gain", "dist_km") := .(dep_delay - arr_delay, 1.61 * distance)]
    flights
    
    flights[, c("gain", "dist_km") := .(NULL, NULL)]
    flights
    ```

- **Exercise**: Add a variable called `speed` that is the average air speed
  of the plane in miles per hour. Then remove this variable.
  
    ```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
    flights[, "speed" := .(distance / air_time * 60)]
    flights
    
    flights[, "speed" := NULL]
    flights
    ```

## Group Summaries

- You calculate summaries in the column slot. It's best to use the list method.

    ```{r, results = "hide"}
    ## data.table way
    flights[, .(dd = mean(dep_delay))]
    
    ## equivalent tidyverse way
    flights_tib %>%
      summarize(dd = mean(dep_delay))
    ```
    
    ```{r, results = "hide"}
    ## data.table way
    flights[, .(dd = mean(dep_delay), ad = mean(arr_delay))]
    
    ## equivalent tidyverse way
    flights_tib %>%
      summarize(dd = mean(dep_delay), ad = mean(arr_delay))
    ```

- Count the number of rows with `.N`.

    ```{r, results = "hide"}
    ## data.table way
    flights[, .(.N)]
    
    ## equivalent tidyverse way
    flights_tib %>%
      count()
    ```

- In data.table, you create grouped summaries by simultaneously grouping
  and calculating summaries in one line, not separately like in dplyr.
  
- In data.table, you use the `by` argument to specify the grouping variable.
  It should also be a list.

    ```{r, results = "hide"}
    ## data.table way
    flights[, .(dd = mean(dep_delay)) , by = .(origin)]
    
    ## equivalent tidyverse way
    flights_tib %>%
      group_by(origin) %>%
      summarize(dd = mean(dep_delay))
    ```
    
- You can calculate more than one group summary at a time, or group by more
  than one variable.
  
    ```{r, results = "hide"}
    ## data.table way
    flights[, .(dd = mean(dep_delay), .N), by = .(origin, carrier)]
    
    ## equivalent tidyverse way
    flights_tib %>%
      group_by(origin, carrier) %>%
      summarize(dd = mean(dep_delay), N = n())
    ```
  
- **Exercise**: Use data.table to calculate the median air time for each month.

    ```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
    flights[, .(median(air_time)), by = .(month)]
    ```
  
- **Exercise**: Use data.table to calculate the number of trips from each airport for the
  carrier code DL.
  
    ```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
    flights[carrier == "DL", .(.N), by = .(origin)]
    ```
    
- **Exercise**: Use data.table to calculate the mean departure delay for each origin 
  in the months of January and February.
  
    ```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
    flights[month %in% c(1, 2), .(mean(dep_delay)), by = .(month, origin)]
    ```
    
## Recoding

- Suppose you want to change the values of a variable. In the tidyverse, 
  we used `recode()` to do this.

- In data.table, we filter the rows then mutate by reference.

- Let's substitute `24` in `hour` to `0`.

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    sort(unique(flights$hour))
    sort(unique(flights_tib$hour))
    ```
    
    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    ## data.table way
    flights[hour == 24L, hour := 0L]
    
    ## equivalent tidyverse way
    flights_tib %>%
      mutate(hour = recode(hour, `24` = 0L)) ->
      flights_tib
    ```
    
    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    sort(unique(flights$hour))
    sort(unique(flights_tib$hour))
    ```
    
- **Exercise**: In the `origin` variable, change `"JFK"` to `"John F. Kennedy"`,
  `"LGA"` to `"LaGuardia"`, and `"EWR"` to `"Newark Liberty"`.
  
    ```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
    flights[origin == "JFK", origin := "John F. Kennedy"]
    flights[origin == "LGA", origin := "LaGuardia"]
    flights[origin == "EWR", origin := "Newark Liberty"]
    ```
  
## Gathering

- Problem: One variable spread across multiple columns.

- Column names are actually *values* of a variable

- Recall `table4a` and `table4b` from the tidyr package

    ```{r}
    dt4a <- as.data.table(tidyr::table4a)
    dt4b <- as.data.table(tidyr::table4b)
    dt4a
    dt4b
    ```

- Solution: `melt()`:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ## data.table way
    melt(dt4a, 
         id.vars       = c("country"),
         measure.vars  = c("1999", "2000"),
         variable.name = "year",
         value.name    = "count")
    
    ## Equivalent tidyverse way
    tidyr::table4a %>%
      gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "count")
    
    ## or
    tidyr::table4a %>%
      pivot_longer(cols = c("1999", "2000"), 
                   names_to = "year", 
                   values_to = "count")
    ```

- RDS visualization:

    ![](./figs/tidy-9.png)\

- **Exercise**: gather the `monkeymem` data frame (available at
  <https://data-science-master.github.io/lectures/data/tidy_exercise/monkeymem.csv>). 
  The cell values represent identification accuracy of some objects (in percent of 20 
  trials).

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
    monkeymem <- fread("../data/tidy_exercise/monkeymem.csv")
    melt(monkeymem, 
         id.vars       = c("Monkey", "Treatment"),
         measure.vars  = c("Week2", "Week4", "Week8", "Week12", "Week16"),
         variable.name = "Week", value.name = "Percent")
    ```

## Spreading

- Problem: One observation is spread across multiple rows.

- One column contains variable names. One column contains values for the 
  different variables.

- Recall `table2` from the tidyr package

    ```{r}
    dt2 <- as.data.table(tidyr::table2)
    dt2
    ```

- Solution: `dcast()`. In the `formula` argument, put the "id variables"
  to the left and the "key" variables to the right. In tidyverse jargon, 
  the `value` is everything not stated in the formula and the `key` is everything
  to the left of the tilde.
  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ## data.table way
    dcast(dt2, formula = country + year ~ type, value.var = "count")
    
    ## Equivalent tidyverse way
    tidyr::table2 %>%
      spread(key = type, value = count)
    
    ## or
    tidyr::table2 %>%
      pivot_wider(id_cols = c("country", "year"), 
                  names_from = "type", 
                  values_from = "count")
    ```

- RDS visualization:

    ![](./figs/tidy-8.png)\ 

- **Exercise**: Spread the `flowers1` data frame (available at
  <https://data-science-master.github.io/lectures/data/tidy_exercise/flowers1.csv>).

    ```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    flowers1 <- fread("../data/tidy_exercise/flowers1.csv")
    dcast(flowers1, Time + replication ~ Variable, value.var = "Value")
    ```

## Separating

- To separate a column into two columns, use the base function `tstrsplit()`.
    
    ```{r}
    dt3 <- as.data.table(tidyr::table3)
    dt3
    ```
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ## data.table way
    dt3[, c("cases", "population") := tstrsplit(rate, split = "/")]
    dt3[, rate := NULL]
    dt3
    
    ## equivalent tidyverse way
    tidyr::table3 %>%
      separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), sep = "/")
    ```

- RDS visualization:

    ![](./figs/tidy-17.png)\ 
    
- **Exercise**: Separate the `flowers2` data frame (available at
  <https://data-science-master.github.io/lectures/data/tidy_exercise/flowers2.csv>).
  
    ```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
    flowers2 <- fread("../data/tidy_exercise/flowers2.csv")
    
    flowers2[, c("Flowers", "Intensity") := tstrsplit(`Flowers/Intensity`, split = "/")]
    flowers2[, `Flowers/Intensity` := NULL]
    flowers2
    ```
  

## Uniting

- To unite, use `paste()`.

    ```{r}
    dt5 <- as.data.table(tidyr::table5)
    dt5
    ```


    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ## data.table way
    dt5[, year := paste(century, year, sep = "")]
    dt5[, century := NULL]
    dt5
    
    ## Equivalent tidyverse way
    tidyr::table5 %>%
      unite(century, year, col = "year", sep = "")
    ```

- RDS visualization:

    ![](./figs/tidy-18.png)\
    
- **Exercise**: Re-unite the data frame you separated from the flowers2 
  exercise. Use a comma for the separator.
  
    ```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
    flowers2[, flowers_intensity := .(paste(Flowers, Intensity, sep = ","))]
    flowers2[, c("Flowers", "Intensity") := .(NULL, NULL)]
    flowers2
    ```
  
## Chaining

- In the tidyverse, we chain commands by using the pipe `%>%`. In data.table, we
  chain commands by adding additional brackets after the brackets we used.
  Data.table makes this very efficient.
  
- Let's calculate the mean arrival delay for american airlines for each
  origin/destination pair, then order the results by origin in increasing order,
  breaking ties by destination in decreasing order.

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    ## data.table way
    flights[carrier == "AA", .(ad = mean(arr_delay)), by = .(origin, dest)][order(origin, -dest)]
    
    ## Usual indentation for readability:
    flights[carrier == "AA", .(ad = mean(arr_delay)), by = .(origin, dest)
            ][order(origin, -dest)]
    
    ## Equivalent tidyverse way
    flights_tib %>%
      filter(carrier == "AA") %>%
      group_by(origin, dest) %>%
      summarize(ad = mean(arr_delay)) %>%
      arrange(origin, desc(dest))
    ```
    
## Joining

- We'll use the following `data.table`s to introduce joining.

    ```{r}
    xdf <- data.table(mykey = c("1", "2", "3"),
                      x_val = c("x1", "x2", "x3"))
    ydf <- data.table(mykey = c("1", "2", "4"),
                      y_val = c("y1", "y2", "y3"))
    xdf
    ydf
    ```
    
    ![](./figs/join-setup.png)\ 

- Use the `merge()` function for *all* joining in data.table.

- Inner Join:

    ![](./figs/join-inner.png)\ 
    
    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    ## data.table way
    merge(xdf, ydf, by = "mykey")
    
    ## equivalent tidyverse way
    inner_join(xdf, ydf, by = "mykey")
    ```
    
- Outer Joins

    ![](./figs/join-outer.png)\ 
    
- Left Join

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    ## data.table way
    merge(xdf, ydf, by = "mykey", all.x = TRUE)
    
    ## equivalent tidyverse way
    left_join(xdf, ydf, by = "mykey")
    ```
    
- Right Join

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    ## data.table way
    merge(xdf, ydf, by = "mykey", all.y = TRUE)
    
    ## equivalent tidyverse way
    right_join(xdf, ydf, by = "mykey")
    ```
    
- Outer Join

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    ## data.table way
    merge(xdf, ydf, by = "mykey", all.x = TRUE, all.y = TRUE)
    
    ## equivalent tidyverse way
    full_join(xdf, ydf, by = "mykey")
    ```

- Binding Rows:

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    ## data.table way
    rbind(xdf, ydf, fill = TRUE)
    
    ## equivalent tidyverse way
    bind_rows(xdf, ydf)
    ```

- When you have different key names, use the `by.x` and `by.y` arguments instead
  of the `by` argument.
    ```{r}
    names(ydf)[1] <- "newkey"
    ydf
    ```
    
    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    ## data.table way
    merge(xdf, ydf, by.x = "mykey", by.y = "newkey")
    
    ## equivalent tidyverse way
    inner_join(xdf, ydf, by = c("mykey" = "newkey"))
    ```
    
- **Exercise**: Recall the `nycflights13` dataset
    ```{r, message = FALSE}
    library(nycflights13)
    data("flights")
    data("airlines")
    data("planes")
    flights  <- as.data.table(flights)
    airlines <- as.data.table(airlines)
    planes   <- as.data.table(planes)
    ```
    Add the full airline names to the `flights` data.table.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    flights <- merge(flights, airlines, by = "carrier")
    ```
    
- **Exercise**: Select all flights that use a plane where you have some annotation.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    flights_sub <- merge(flights, planes[, .(tailnum)], by = "tailnum")
    ```

There is **so** much more to data.table. You can do quite complicated and
sophisticated data manipulations using data.table that would require a lot
more typing in the tidyverse. I am not an expert in much of this 
functionality. A large number of articles and
references are given on the homepage:
