# Learning Objectives

- Automated workflow with GNU make.
- Required Reading:
    - [Minimal Make](https://kbroman.org/minimal_make/)
    - [Makefile Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile)
- Additional Resources
    - [Official Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)
    - [Managing Projects with GNU Make](http://uploads.mitechie.com/books/Managing_Projects_with_GNU_Make_Third_Edition.pdf)
    - [Using *GNU Make* to Manage the Workflow of Data Analysis Projects](./baker_2020.pdf)
    - [Stat 545 Chapter on Make](https://stat545.com/automating-pipeline.html)
    
# Installation Mac/Linux

- If you are using Mac or Linux, you probably have `make` already installed.
    - To verify, open up the terminal and run `make --version`
    
# Installation Windows

- This is one of the cases where Windows is really inferior to Mac and Linux. I will show you two pipelines. You only need to choose one pipeline.

## Use Rtools (light)

- Download and install Rtools: <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>

<!-- - You can use `make` in windows (<http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm>) -->

- Add `make` to the PATH whenever you open R via typing the following in R:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    writeLines('PATH="${RTOOLS40_HOME}\\usr\\bin;${PATH}"', con = "~/.Renviron")
    ```

- Restart R

- Change R Studio's settings "Global Options... > Terminal > New terminals open with" so that it reads "Windows Powershell". This will make it so that the terminal is [Windows PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell), **not** git bash (so it will look a little weird and act a little differently).

- Open a new terminal. Again, this is a [Windows PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell).

- Always run `make` in the Windows PowerShell from R Studio. This pipeline won't work if you try to directly open the PowerShell outside of R Studio.

- You can always convert the terminal back to git bash later.

- I am not a big fan of RStudio Projects, but if you like them then there is some R Studio `make` functionality when you use an RStudio Project (<https://stat545.com/make-test-drive.html>). This lets you avoid using Windows PowerShell.
    
## Windows Subsystem for Linux (heavy)

- Only start this if you are willing to spend a few hours fiddling around your computer.

- You can install Ubuntu on Windows to use all of its powerful features. This is what you would need to do for more advanced computational operations. This is how I use Windows.

- But on Ubuntu, you'll need to install a *separate* version of R, all of the R packages that you usually use, and git.

- **NOTE**: This strategy could take up to a gigabyte of storage.

- Install Ubuntu using these directions: <https://ubuntu.com/wsl>

- Install `r-base-dev` using the instructions found by heading to <https://cran.r-project.org/> then navigating to "Download R for Linux > ubuntu/"

    - Try installing it without Secure Apt first. But you'll probablly need to run the following to install it:
    
        ```{bash, eval=FALSE}
        sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9
        ```
    

- In Ubuntu open up the command line for R

    ```
    R
    ```
    
- In the R command prompt, install all of the R packages you will need with `install.packages()`. You can exit R afterwards with `q()`.

- Change R Studio's settings "Global Options... > Terminal > New terminals open with" so that it reads "Bash (Windows Subsystem for Linux)".

- Open up a new terminal, and you should now be using Ubuntu for your terminal.

# Motivation

- There are a lot of steps in a data analysis
    - Download data (`httr`) `|>` <br>
      tidy data (`dplyr`, `tidyr`) `|>` <br>
      exploratory data analysis (`ggplot2`, `dplyr`) `|>` <br>
      statistical analysis (`stats`, `broom`, `tidymodels`) `|>` <br>
      present results (`shiny`, `rmarkdown`, `ggplot2`).
  
- Each of these steps should be done in separate files. But a more typical pipeline would include *multiple files for each step*. 
    - Download multiple datasets using multiple scripts
    - Breakdown complex tidying into multiple scripts.
    - Explore many aspects of your data, using multiple scripts.
    - Modify your statistical models based on model-checks.
    - Develop multiple reports on different aspects of your project.
    
- Files downstream in this pipeline typically depend on files upstream in this pipeline.

- Here is a really basic example from a recent project of mine. Each node is a file name. The direction of the arrows indicates the dependency between the files. E.g. "sims.R" is used to create "sims_out.csv".

    ```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    library(tidyverse)
    library(ggdag)
    set.seed(15)
    dagify(`sims_out.csv` ~ `sims.R`,
           `simplots.pdf` ~ `sim_plots.R`,
           `simplots.pdf` ~ `sims_out.csv`,
           `qqplots.pdf` ~ `sim_se_plots.R`,
           `qqplots.pdf` ~ `sims_out.csv`,
           `time.pdf` ~ `time.R`,
           `time.pdf` ~ `sims_out.csv`) |>
      ggdag(layout = "sugiyama",
            text_col = "black",
            node = FALSE) +
      theme_void()
    ```

    The top row contains R scripts. The middle row contains some simulation output (sims_out.csv), and the bottom row contains the output of my analyses.

- If I make a modification to "time.R", I would only need to re-generate "time.pdf", since that is the only downstream file.

- However, if I modify "sims.R" and re-generate "sims_out.csv", then I should also re-generate "simplots.pdf", "qqplots.pdf", and "time.pdf" because all of those files are created using "sims_out.csv".

- Having to manually remember to re-run all these scripts is prone to error (because of forgetfulness, tediousness, etc), so ideally there should be some automated way to know that when a file upstream as been changed, then all downstream files need to be re-generated.

- *This is exactly what make does!*

# Make

- You place all commands for `make` in a file *exactly* titled "Makefile". You can create this file in the terminal via

    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    touch Makefile
    ```
    
## Rules

- Inside the Makefile, you prepare a series of *rules* of the form

    ```
    target: prereq_1 prereq_2 prereq_3 ...
      first bash command to make target
      second bash command and so on
    ```

- Each *rule* contains three things: a *target*, *prerequisites*, and *commands*.

- `target` is the name of the file that will be generated.
- `prereq_1`, `prereq_2`, `prereq_3`, etc are the names of the files which are used to generate `target`. These can be datasets, R scripts, etc.
- Each subsequent line is a *bash* command that will be evaluated in the terminal in the order listed. This sequence of commands is sometimes called a *recipe*.
    - **IMPORTANT**: Make sure each bash command has one **tab** (not spaces) at the start of the line. If you copy and paste a Makefile from a web site then usually tabs are converted to spaces and produce an error!
    - From the terminal, it is possible to evaluate R scripts, python scripts, and knit R Markdown files.
    - You can also use the usual bash commands you are used do (`touch`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, etc...)
    - There are tons of other commands that you can install that allow you to do things like download files ([`curl`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) and [`wget`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wget)), unzip files ([`7z`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-Zip) and [`tar`](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/tar.html#SEC25)), [`convert`](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php) image files, compile LaTeX documents, etc...

## Useful bash commands for data science

- Run an R script
    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    R CMD BATCH --no-save --no-restore input_file.R output_file.Rout
    ```
    
    Make sure to change "input_file.R" and "output_file.Rout"
    
    - The `--no-save --no-restore` options make sure that you are working with a clean environment and that you don't save this environment after the command is executed. This is a good thing for reproducibility.

- Knit an R Markdown file
    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    Rscript -e "library(rmarkdown);render('rmarkdown_file.Rmd')"
    ```

    Make sure to change "rmarkdown_file.Rmd"

- Run python script

    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    python3 input_file.py
    ```
    
    Make sure to change "input_file.py"
    
- Download data from the web

    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    wget --no-clobber url_to_data
    ```

## Phony Targets

- If you have multiple, related, final outputs, it is common to place these as prerequisites to "phony" targets:

    ```
    .PHONY : phony_target
    phony_target : target1 target2 target3 ...
    ```
    
    where "phony_target" is a name you provide to represent the operation being performed.
    
- "Phony" targets are not real files. They are just convenient names to use to describe a collection of targets that should be generated.
    
- At the *top* of the makefile, you then list the phony targets after `all`:

    ```
    all : phony_target1 phony_target2 phony_target3 ...
    ```

- **NOTE**: It is important to have `all : phony_target1 phony_target2` as the very first *rule* because by default `make` will only evaluate the very first rule in the file. So if `all` is first, then `make` will evaluate all targets.

## Comments

- Use a hashtag `#` for comments in a makefile.
    
## Pseudo-code for Makefile

``` make
all : phony_target1 phony_target2

.PHONY : phony_target1
phony_target1 : target1 target2

.PHONY : phony_target2
phony_target2 : target3

# Comment 1
target1 : prereq1.R data0.csv data1.RDS
  R CMD BATCH --no-save --no-restore prereq1.R prereq1_out.Rout

# Comment 2
target2 : prereq2.py data2.csv
  python prereq2.py

# Comment 3
target3 : prereq3.Rmd
  Rscript -e "library(rmarkdown);render('prereq3.Rmd')"
```

## Evaluate a makefile

- You can generate all target files by running the following in the terminal

    ``` bash
    make
    ```

- You can run just the targets in a phony target by specifying the phony target

    ``` bash
    make phony_target
    ```

- Make will check if any of the prerequisites have changes for each `target` and, if so, will re-run the bash commands of that *rule*.

- `Make` will not re-run commands if the prerequisites have not changed. That is, if no upstream files to `target` were modified, then `target` will not be re-generated. This makes `make` very efficient.

## Working directory considerations

- tl;dr
    - For R and the terminal: Assume the working directory is the location of the Makefile.
    - For R Markdown: Assume the working directory is the location of the Rmd file.

- So if your file structure is

    ```
    Makefile
    analysis/script.R
    analysis/report.Rmd
    data/data.csv
    ```
    
    Then you need specify your targets according to this structure
    
    ``` make
    data/data.csv : analysis/script.R
      R CMD BATCH --no-save --no-restore analysis/script.R
    ```
    
     **NOTE** that the following will **not** work because each command is executed in its *own* subshell (assuming the working directory is the location of the Makefile): 
     
    ``` make
    # DOES NOT WORK
    data/data.csv : analysis/script.R
      cd analysis 
      R CMD BATCH --no-save --no-restore script.R
    ```
    
    But you can get around this by putting these commands on one line, with each command separated by a semicolon:
    
    ``` make
    # Works, but not recommended
    data/data.csv : analysis/script.R
      cd analysis; R CMD BATCH --no-save --no-restore script.R
    ```
    
- Any file manipulation in "script.R" needs to be done assuming the working directory is where Makefile is (**notice the single dot**):
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    library(readr)
    dat <- read_csv("./data/data.csv")
    ```
    
- However, confusingly, when you render an R Markdown file using `knitr`, you need to assume the working directory is the location of the R Markdown file, not the location of `Makefile`. So in "report.Rmd" you would write (**notice the double dots**)

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    library(readr)
    dat <- read_csv("../data/data.csv")
    ```

# A worked example

- I created a repo with a very basic example of using a Makefile: <https://github.com/data-science-master/pvalue_sims>

- The files after everything is evaluated are:
    - Makefile
    - Readme.Rmd
    - Readme.md
    - analysis
        - add_alt_sims.R
        - null_sims.R
        - panal.html
        - panal.Rmd
    - output
        - add_alt_sims.Rout
        - null_sims.Rout
        - pdat.csv
        - pnull.RDS

- These files have the following dependency structure:

    ```{r another-dependency, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    library(tidyverse)
    library(ggdag)
    set.seed(15)
    dagify("pnull.RDS" ~ "null_sims.R",
           "pdat.csv" ~ "add_alt_sims.R",
           "pdat.csv" ~ "pnull.RDS",
           "panal.html" ~ "panal.Rmd",
           "panal.html" ~ "pdat.csv") |>
      ggdag(layout = "sugiyama",
            text_col = "black",
            node = FALSE) +
      theme_void() +
      xlim(-0.5, 2.5)
    ```

- The Makefile that organizes this structure is

    ``` make
    all : sims
    
    .PHONY : sims
    sims : analysis/panal.html
    
    analysis/panal.html : analysis/panal.Rmd output/pdat.csv
    	Rscript -e "library(rmarkdown);render('analysis/panal.Rmd')"
    
    output/pnull.RDS : analysis/null_sims.R
    	R CMD BATCH --no-save --no-restore analysis/null_sims.R output/null_sims.Rout
    
    output/pdat.csv : analysis/add_alt_sims.R output/pnull.RDS
    	R CMD BATCH --no-save --no-restore analysis/add_alt_sims.R output/add_alt_sims.Rout
    ```
    
- **Exercise**: Clone this repo and run `make` in the terminal.

- **Exercise**: What happens when you modify "panal.Rmd" and you rerun `make`?

- **Exercise**: What happens when you modify "add_alt_sims.R" and rerun `make`?

- **Exercise**: What happens when you modify "null_sims.R" and rerun `make`?

# Your turn

- Clone the penguins repo: <https://github.com/data-science-master/penguins>

- Use your new skills to create a makefile to manage a small project that examines the really cool [Palmer Penguins data](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

- The files in the final report are:
    - Makefile
    - Readme.Rmd
    - Readme.md
    - analysis
        - classify_penguins.R
        - penguin_report.html
        - penguin_report.Rmd
        - plot_penguin.R
    - output
        - penguin_class.csv
        - penguin_pairs.png

- These files have the following dependency structure:

    ```{r dependency-graph, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    library(tidyverse)
    library(ggdag)
    set.seed(15)
    dagify("penguin_pairs.png" ~ "plot_penguin.R",
           "penguin_class.csv" ~ "classify_penguins.R",
           "penguin_report.html" ~ "penguin_pairs.png",
           "penguin_report.html" ~ "penguin_class.csv",
           "penguin_report.html" ~ "penguin_report.Rmd") |>
      ggdag(layout = "sugiyama",
            text_col = "black",
            node = FALSE) +
      theme_void() +
      xlim(-0.5, 2.5)
    ```

0. Make sure you have the necessary R packages installed:

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    library(tidyverse)
    library(tidymodels)
    library(GGally)
    library(palmerpenguins)
    library(randomForest)
    ```

1. Modify the Makefile to automatically manage this pipeline.

2. Run `make` in the terminal to generate all of the output (penguin_class.csv, penguin_pairs.png, and penguin_report.html)

3. Change the color scheme in the pairs plot and re-run `make`.

4. Correct the date field in the YAML header in "penguin_report.html" and re-run `make`

# Variables

- You usually define variables at the top of a file use an equals sign (`=`).

    ``` make
    my_first_variable = fig.pdf
    ```
    
- You access a variable value by placing the variable name in parentheses after a dollar sign `$`. 

- So when a makefile comes across `$(my_first_variable)`, it will actually read it as `fig.pdf`.

- For example, suppose the file `fig_create.R` generates multiple pdf files: `fig1.pdf`, `fig2.pdf`, and `fig3.pdf`. Then we could write this rule in the following two equivalent ways:

    ``` make
    fig1.pdf fig2.pdf fig3.pdf : fig_create.R
      R CMD BATCH --no-save --no-restore fig_create.R
    ```
    
    ``` make
    figs = fig1.pdf fig2.pdf fig3.pdf
    $(figs) : fig_create.R
      R CMD BATCH --no-save --no-restore fig_create.R
    ```
    
- If you do not like writing `R CMD BATCH --no-save --no-restore` each time, then you can save this command as a variable. The following two rules are equivalent:

    ``` make
    fig.pdf : script.R
      R CMD BATCH --no-save --no-restore script.R
    ```
    
    ``` make
    rexec = R CMD BATCH --no-save --no-restore
    fig.pdf : script.R
      $(rexec) script.R
    ```
    
- **Exercise**: Modify the following Makefile (from the p-value exercise) to use variables that reduce the amount of copying/pasting:

    ``` make
    all : sims
    
    .PHONY : sims
    sims : analysis/panal.html
    
    analysis/panal.html : analysis/panal.Rmd output/pdat.csv
    	Rscript -e "library(rmarkdown);render('analysis/panal.Rmd')"
    
    output/pnull.RDS : analysis/null_sims.R
    	R CMD BATCH --no-save --no-restore analysis/null_sims.R output/null_sims.Rout
    
    output/pdat.csv : analysis/add_alt_sims.R output/pnull.RDS
    	R CMD BATCH --no-save --no-restore analysis/add_alt_sims.R output/add_alt_sims.Rout
    ```


## Automatic Variables

- There are a lot of [automatic variables](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Automatic-Variables) that you can use to make your Makefile more concise.

- Here are the ones I use:

    - `$@`: The target of the rule.
    - `$<`: The first prerequisite.
    - `$^`: All of the prerequisites, with spaces between them.
    - `$(@D)`: The directory part of the target, with the trailing slash removed.
    - `$(@F)`: The file part of the target
    - `$(<D)`: The directory part of the first prerequisite.
    - `$(<F)`: The file part of the first prerequisite.
    - `$(basename names)`: Extracts all but the suffix of each file name in names.
    
- *Example*: Suppose I have the following rule:
    
    ``` make
    output/figs/foo.pdf : analysis/scripts/gaa.R data/hii.csv
      R CMD BATCH --no-save --no-restore analysis/scripts/gaa.R
    ```
    
    Then the following are these automatic variable values:
    
    - `$@`: output/figs/foo.pdf
    - `$<`: analysis/scripts/gaa.R
    - `$^`: analysis/scripts/gaa.R data/hii.csv
    - `$(@D)`: output/figs
    - `$(@F)`: foo.pdf
    - `$(<D)`: analysis/scripts
    - `$(<F)`: gaa.R
    - `$(basename $(<F))`: gaa

- For example, if you always place the R script first that generates the target, and the datasets that the R script uses second, then the following is typically how I evaluate the R script.

    ``` make
    rexec = R CMD BATCH --no-save --no-restore
    figure.pdf : script.R data1.csv data2.csv
      $(rexec) $< $(basename $(<F)).Rout
    ```
    
    The variables and automatic variables would interpret this as
    
    ``` make
    figure.pdf : script.R data1.csv data2.csv
      R CMD BATCH --no-save --no-restore script.R script.Rout
    ```

- **Exercise**: Re-write the following to use an automatic variable instead of the Rmd's file name in the recipe.

    ``` make
    report.html : report.Rmd
      Rscript -e "library(rmarkdown);render('report.Rmd')"
    ```
    
    ```{bash, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    report.html : report.Rmd
      Rscript -e "library(rmarkdown);render('$<')"
    ```


# Competitors

- There are lots of pipeline management competitors to `make`. The most-likely that you'll run across are
    - [`drake`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=drake) is an R package for interacting with `make`.
    - [`targets`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=targets) is another `make`-like R package.
    - [`snakemake`](https://snakemake.github.io/) is a python-based tool for workflow management that is perhaps more readable than `make` and allows for more options than only using shell commands. This is probably the most popular alternative to `make`.

- But `make` has been around since the 1970s, is widely used, and isn't going anywhere.

- It is also relatively simple compared to more sophisticated pipeline management tools, so I think that makes it easier to setup and use with fewer chances for bugs.
