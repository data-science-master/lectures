# Learning Objectives

- Set up R Studio environment for Python.
- Python REPL.
- Python chunks and Python scripts.
- [Getting Started with Reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/)
- [Installing Python Packages](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/python_packages.html)

# Setting Up Python for R Studio

- Most Python pros use [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) as their 
  [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)
  when developing in Python.

- But for R programmers who only need to dabble in Python (me, for example), 
  we can use R Studio and the reticulate package.
  
    <mark style="background-color: lightblue">R</mark>
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    install.packages("reticulate")
    ```
    
    <mark style="background-color: lightblue">R</mark>
    ```{r}
    library(reticulate)
    ```

- To install a version of Python that reticulate will use, run in the terminal:

    <mark style="background-color: lightblue">R</mark>
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    reticulate::install_miniconda()
    ```
    
- To validate that Python was installed and is available, run

    <mark style="background-color: lightblue">R</mark>
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    reticulate::py_available()
    ```

- To install Python packages, use `py_install()`. For example, we can install
  the numpy, pandas, and matplotlib packages via
  
    <mark style="background-color: lightblue">R</mark>
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    reticulate::py_install(packages = c("numpy", "pandas", "matplotlib"))
    ```

# Python REPL's, Chunks, and Scripts

- To start an [IPython shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPython) --- similar
  to the R command promp --- run the following in R:
    
    <mark style="background-color: lightblue">R</mark>
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    reticulate::repl_python()
    ```
    
    ![](./fig/python1.png)\ 
    
- "REPL" stands for "read–eval–print loop", which is an interactive 
  programming environment (like the R command prompt or the IPython shell).
  
- You can exit the REPL by typing the following:

    <mark style="background-color: lightblue">Python</mark>
    ```{python, eval = FALSE}
    exit
    ```

- You can have Python chunks in R Markdown files by replacing the "`r`" at the
  beginning of the chunk by "`python`":

    ```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, comment = ""}
    cat({
    "  ```{python}
      # Code goes here
      ```"
      })
    ```
    
- You can access R objects in Python using the `r` object. That is, `r.x` will access, in Python, the `x` variable defined using R.

    <mark style="background-color: lightblue">R</mark>
    ```{r}
    x <- c(1, 4, 6, 2)
    ```
    
    <mark style="background-color: lightblue">Python</mark>
    ```{python}
    r.x
    ```
    
- You can access Python objects in R using the `py` object. That is, `py$x` will access, in R, the `x` variable defined using Pythong.

    <mark style="background-color: lightblue">Python</mark>
    ```{python}
    x = [8, 9, 11, 3]
    ```
    
    <mark style="background-color: lightblue">R</mark>
    ```{r}
    py$x
    ```
    
- Sometimes it's buggy, but you can usually begin a Python REPL by also
  hitting Control/Command + Enter inside the Python chunk:
  
    ![](./fig/python3.png)\ 
    
- Python scripts (where there is only Python code and no plain text) end in
  ".py". You can create a Python script in R Studio:
  
    ![](./fig/python2.png)\ 
    
- Hitting Control/Command + Enter inside a Python script will also 
  start a Python REPL.
