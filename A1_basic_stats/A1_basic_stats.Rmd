# Learning Objectives

- Review intermediate Statistics (STAT 302/320/614).
- Probability distributions in R.
- P-values/confidence intervals.
- $t$-tests for means in R.
- Proportion tests in R.

# A Note on this Review

- This review assumes that you have had *some* basic statistics course 
  and have seen all of these concepts in the past.

- If you haven't taken a basic statistics course, you will find this review 
  **very** difficult and incomplete.
  
- If you are having difficulty remembering these topics, then you can review
  them in the free OpenIntro book: <https://leanpub.com/openintro-statistics>.
  The most pertinent sections (from the third edition) 
  are 3.1, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 6.1, 6.2, and 6.5.

# Probability and Distributions in R.

- **Distribution**: The possible values of a variable and how often it takes
  those values. 
  
- A **density** describes the distribution of a *quantitative* variable. 
  You can think of it as approximating a histogram. It is a curve where
  - The area under the curve between any two points is approximately the
    probability of being between those two points.
  - The total area under the curve is 1 (something must happen).
  - The curve is never negative (can't have negative probabilities).
  
- The density of birthweights in America:

    ![](./cartoons/birthweights.png)\ 
  
- The distribution of many variables in Statistics approximate the 
  **normal distribution**.
    - If you know the mean and standard deviation of a normal distribution, then
      you know the whole distribution.
    - Larger standard deviation implies more spread out (larger and smaller values
      are both more likely).
    - Mean determines where the data are centered.

- Normal densities with different means.

- Density Function (height of curve, **NOT** probability of a value).
    ```{r}
    dnorm(x = 2, mean = 1, sd = 1)
    ```
    
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    x <- seq(-2, 4, length = 100)
    y <- dnorm(x, mean = 1, sd = 1)
    qplot(x, y, geom = "line", ylab = "f(x)") +
      geom_segment(dat = data.frame(x = 2, xend = 2, y = 0, 
                                    yend = dnorm(x = 2, mean = 1, sd = 1)), 
                   aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend), lty = 2, col = 2)
    ```
    
- Random Generation (generate samples from a given normal distribution).

    ```{r}
    samp <- rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 1, sd = 1)
    head(samp)
    ```
    
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    qplot(samp, geom = "histogram", fill = I("white"), color = I("black"), bins = 20)
    ```
  
- Cumulative Distribution Function (probability of being less than or equal 
  to some value).

    ```{r}
    pnorm(q = 2, mean = 1, sd = 1)
    ```
    
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    x <- seq(-2, 4, length = 500)
    y <- dnorm(x, mean = 1, sd = 1)
    polydf <- data.frame(x = c(min(x), x[x < 2], 2, 0), 
                         y = c(0, y[x < 2], 0, 0))
    qplot(x, y, geom = "line", ylab = "f(x)") +
      geom_polygon(data = polydf, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y), 
                   fill = "blue", alpha = 1/4)
    ```
    
- Quantile function (find value that has a given the probability of being less 
  than or equal to it).
  
    ```{r}
    qnorm(p = 0.8413, mean = 1, sd = 1)
    ```
    
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    x <- seq(-2, 4, length = 500)
    y <- dnorm(x, mean = 1, sd = 1)
    polydf <- data.frame(x = c(min(x), x[x < 2], 2, 0), 
                         y = c(0, y[x < 2], 0, 0))
    qplot(x, y, geom = "line", ylab = "f(x)") +
      geom_polygon(data = polydf, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y), 
                   fill = "blue", alpha = 1/4) +
      annotate(geom = "text", x = 0.5, y = 0.1, label = "0.8413", color = "black")
    ```  
    
- **Exercise**: Use `rnorm()` to generate 10,000 random draws from a normal 
  distribution with mean 5 and standard deviation 2. What proportion are
  less than 3? Can you think up a way to approximate this proportion using
  a different function?
  
    ```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
    samp <- rnorm(n = 10000, mean = 5, sd = 2)
    mean(samp < 3)
    pnorm(q = 3, mean = 5, sd = 2)
    ```
  
- **Exercise**: In Hong Kong, human male height is approximately normally
  distributed with mean 171.5 cm and standard deviation 5.5 cm. What 
  proportion of the Hong Kong population is between 170 cm and 180 cm?
    
    ```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
    pless180 <- pnorm(q = 180, mean = 171.5, sd = 5.5)
    pless170 <- pnorm(q = 170, mean = 171.5, sd = 5.5)
    pbetween <- pless180 - pless170
    pbetween
    ```
    
- The $t$-distribution shows up a lot in Statistics. 
    - It is also bell-curved but has "thicker tails" (more extreme observations 
      are more likely). 
    - It is always centered at 0. 
    - It only has one parameter, called the "degrees of freedom", which 
      determines how thick the tails are.
    - Smaller degrees of freedom mean thicker tails, larger degrees of freedom
      means thinner tails.
    - If the degrees of freedom is large enough, the $t$-distribution
      is approximately the same as a normal distribution with mean 0
      and variance 1.
      
- $t$-distributions with different degrees of freedom:

    ```{r, echo=FALSE}
    x <- seq(-4, 4, length = 200)
    data.frame(df = as.factor(c(rep(1, length(x)), rep(5, length(x)), rep(Inf, length(x)))),
               x = c(x, x, x),
               y = c(dt(x = x, df = 1),
                     dt(x = x, df = 5),
                     dt(x = x, df = Inf))) ->
      dfdat
    ggplot(dfdat, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y, color = df, lty = df)) +
      geom_line() +
      scale_color_colorblind() +
      ylab("f(x)")
    ```


- Density Function

    ```{r}
    dt(x = -6, df = 2)
    ```
    
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    x <- seq(-6, 6, length = 100)
    y <- dt(x, df = 1)
    qplot(x, y, geom = "line", ylab = "f(x)") +
      geom_segment(dat = data.frame(x = 2, xend = 2, y = 0,
                                    yend = dt(x = 2, df = 2)), 
                   aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend), lty = 2, col = 2)
    ```
    
- Random Generation

    ```{r}
    samp <- rt(n = 1000, df = 2)
    head(samp)
    ```
    
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    qplot(samp, geom = "histogram", fill = I("white"), color = I("black"), bins = 20)
    ```
    
- Cumulative Distribution Function

    ```{r}
    pt(q = 2, df = 2)
    ```
    
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    x <- seq(-6, 6, length = 500)
    y <- dt(x,  df = 2)
    polydf <- data.frame(x = c(min(x), x[x < 2], 2, 0), 
                         y = c(0, y[x < 2], 0, 0))
    qplot(x, y, geom = "line", ylab = "f(x)") +
      geom_polygon(data = polydf, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y), 
                   fill = "blue", alpha = 1/4)
    ```
    
- Quantile Function

    ```{r}
    qt(p = 0.9082, df = 2)
    ```
    
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    x <- seq(-6, 6, length = 500)
    y <- dt(x, df = 2)
    polydf <- data.frame(x = c(min(x), x[x < 2], 2, 0), 
                         y = c(0, y[x < 2], 0, 0))
    qplot(x, y, geom = "line", ylab = "f(x)") +
      geom_polygon(data = polydf, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y), 
                   fill = "blue", alpha = 1/4) +
      annotate(geom = "text", x = 0, y = 0.1, label = "0.9082", color = "black")
    ```
      
      
- There are many other distributions implemented in R. To see the most common,
  run:
  
    ```{r,eval=FALSE}
    help("Distributions")
    ```
  
- **Exercise**: Calculate the 0.75 quantile of the $t$-distribution for 
  degrees of freedom $1, 2, 3,\ldots,50$. Reproduce this plot:
  
    ````{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
    library(tidyverse)
    tibble(df = seq_len(50)) %>%
      mutate(quant75 = qt(p = 0.75, df = df)) %>%
      ggplot(aes(x = df, y = quant75)) +
      geom_line() +
      xlab("Degrees of Freedom") +
      ylab("0.75 Quantile")
    ```
    
    Can you use a function to come up with the asymptotic value of the 0.75
    quantile as the degrees of freedom approaches infinity?
    
    ```{r,echo=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
    qnorm(0.75)
    ```
    
  
# All of Statistics

- **Observational/experimental Units**: The people/places/things/animals/groups
  that we collect information about. Also known as "individuals" or "cases".
  Sometimes I just say "units".
  
- **Variable**: A property of the observational/experimental units. 
    - E.g.: height of a person, area of a country, marital status.
    
- **Value**: The specific level of a variable for an observational/experimental 
  unit.
    - E.g.: Bob is 5'11'', China has an area of 3,705,407 square miles, Jane is divorced.
    
- **Quantitative Variable**: The variable takes on numerical values where arithmetic 
  operations (plus/minus/divide/times) make sense. 
    - E.g.: height, weight, area, income.
    - Counterexample: Phone numbers, social security numbers.
    
- **Categorical Variable**: The variable puts observational/experimental units 
  into different groups/categories based on the values of that variable.
    - E.g.: race/ethnicity, marital status, religion.

- **Binary Variable**: A categorical variable that takes on only two values.
    - E.g.: dead/alive, treatment/control.
    
- **Population**: The collection of all observational units we are interested in. 

- **Parameter**: A numerical summary of the population.
    - E.g.: Average height, proportion of people who are divorced, standard
      deviation of weight.

- **Sample**: A subset of the population (some observational units, but 
  not all of them).

- **Statistic**: A numeric summary of the sample.
    - E.g.: Average height of the sample, proportion of people who are 
      divorced in the sample, standard deviation of weight of a sample.
      
- Graphic:
    
    ![](./cartoons/pop_vs_sample.png)\ 

- **Sampling Distribution**: The distribution of a statistic over
  many hypothetical random samples from the population.
  
    ![](./cartoons/sampling_dist.png)\ 

- All of Statistics: We see a pattern in the sample.
    - **Estimation**: Guess the pattern in the population based on the sample. 
      Guess a parameter with a statistic. A statistic which is a guess for a 
      parameter is called an **estimate**.
    - **Hypothesis Testing**: Ask if the pattern we see in the sample also
      exists in the population. Test if a parameter is some value.
    - **Confidence Intervals**: Quantify our (un)certainty of the pattern 
      in the population based on the sample. Provide a range of likely 
      parameter values.

- We will go through a lot of examples of this below    

- For the examples below, we will use the data from the Sleuth3 package in R.
    
    ```{r, message=FALSE}
    library(Sleuth3)
    library(tidyverse)
    library(broom)
    ```

- **Exercise**: Read the help page of the `ex0126` data frame from the Sleuth3
  package. What are the observational units? What are the variables? Which
  are quantitative and which are categorical?
  
    ```{block, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
    - Observational Units: the members of the US House of Representatives.
    - Variables: `State` (categorical), `Representative` (primary key), `Party` 
      (categorical), `Pro05` (quantitative), `Anti05` (quantitative), 
      `Pro06` (quantitative), `Anti06` (quantitative), `Pro07` (quantitative),
      `Anti07` (quantitative), `PctPro` (quantitative).
    ```
  
- **Exercise**: Read the help page of the `ex0223` data frame from the Sleuth3
  package. What are the observational units? What are the variables? Which
  are quantitative and which are categorical?
  
    ```{block, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
    - Observational Units: The states (and DC).
    - Variables: `State` (primary key), `Fatalities1995` (quantitative),
      `Fatalities1996` (quantitative), `PctChange` (quantitative),
      `SpeedLimit` (categorical).
    ```

  
# Pattern: Mean is shifted (one quantitative variable)

- Example: Researchers measured the volume of the left hippocampus in 15 twins
  where one twin had schizophrenia and the other did not. They were interested
  in whether the left hippocampus differed in size between the normal and 
  schizophrenic twin.
  
- Observational Units: The twins.

- Population: All twins where one has schizophrenia and the other 
  does not.
  
- Sample: The 15 twins in our study.
  
- Variable: The difference in volume in the left hippocampus between the twins.
  We derived this quantitative variable by subtracting one volume from another.
    ```{r}
    case0202 %>%
      as_tibble() %>%
      mutate(diff = Unaffected - Affected) %>%
      select(diff) ->
      schizo
    glimpse(schizo)
    ```

- Pattern: Use a histogram/boxplot to visualize the shift from 0.

    ```{r}
    ggplot(schizo, aes(x = diff)) +
      geom_histogram(bins = 15, fill = "white", color = "black") +
      geom_vline(xintercept = 0, lty = 2) +
      xlab("Difference in Brain Volumes")
    ```

- Graphic: 

    ![](./cartoons/twins1.png)\ 
    
- Parameter of interest: Mean difference in left hippocampus volumes for all twins.

- Estimate: Use sample mean

    ```{r}
    schizo %>%
      summarize(meandiff = mean(diff))
    ```
    
- 0.199 is our "best guess" for the parameter, but it is almost certainly not
  the value of the parameter (since we didn't measure everyone).

- Hypothesis Testing: 
    - We are interested in if the mean difference is different from 0. 
    - Two possibilities:
        1. **Alternative Hypothesis**: Mean is different from 0.
        2. **Null Hypothesis**: Mean is not different from 0, we just happened
           *by chance* to get twins that had a big difference in volume.
    - Strategy: We calculate the probability of the data assuming possibility 2 
      (called a $p$-value). If this probability is low, we conclude possibility 1. 
      If the this probability is high, we don't conclude anything.
    - **p-value**: the probability that you would see data as or more 
      supportive of the alternative hypothesis than what you saw 
      *assuming that the null hypothesis is true*.

- Graphic:

    ![](./cartoons/p-value.png)\ 
    
- The distribution of possible null sample means is given by statistical theory.
  Specifically, the $t$-statistic (mean divided by the standard deviation of the
  sampling distribution of the mean) has a $t$ distribution with
  $n - 1$ degrees of freedom ($n$ is the sample size). 
  It works as long as your data aren't too skewed or if you have a large 
  enough sample size.

- Function: `t.test()`

    ```{r}
    tout <- t.test(schizo$diff)
    tout
    ```
    
- The `tidy()` function from the broom package will format the output of common
  procedures to a convenient data frame.
  
    ```{r}
    tdf <- tidy(tout)
    tdf$estimate
    tdf$p.value
    ```
    
- We often want a range of "likely" values. These are called confidence
  intervals. `t.test()` will return these confidence intervals, giving
  lowest and highest likely values for the mean difference in volumes:
    ```{r}
    tdf$conf.low
    tdf$conf.high
    ```
    
- Interpreting confidence intervals:
    - CORRECT: We used a procedure that would capture the true parameter in 95%
      of repeated samples.
    - CORRECT: *Prior to sampling*, the probability of capturing the true
      parameter is 0.95.
    - WRONG: After sampling, the probability of capturing the true parameter
      is 0.95. 
        - Because after sampling the parameter is either in the interval
          or it's not. We just don't know which.
    - WRONG: 95% of twins have volume differences within the bounds of the 95% 
      confidence interval. 
        - Because confidence intervals are statements about
          parameters, not observational units or statistics.

           sample = rep(1:nind, each = ncoll)) %>%
      group_by(sample) %>%
      nest() %>%
      mutate(ttest = map(data, ~t.test(.$diff2)),
             ttest = map(ttest, tidy)) %>%
      unnest(ttest, .drop = TRUE) %>%

- Intuition: Statistical theory tells us that the sample mean will be
  within (approximately) 2 standard deviations of the population 
  mean in 95% of repeated samples. This is two standard deviations
  of the sampling distribution of the sample mean, *not* two standard
  deviations of the sample. So we just add and subtract (approximately)
  two standard deviations of the sampling distribution from the sample mean.

- **Exercise**: An investor sued his broker for lack of diversification. Below
  are the rates of return (in percent) for the investor's portfolio over 39 
  months (data from @moore1998introduction). The average of the S&P 500 stock 
  index for the same period was 0.95%. Does the broker perform worse than
  average? Explore the data, set up hypotheses, and run the appropriate test.

    ```{r}
    stock <- tibble(return = c(-8.36,   1.63,  -2.27, -2.93,  -2.70,

                               -3.58,   6.13,   7.00, -15.25, -8.66,

    ```

    ```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
    ggplot(stock, aes(x = return)) +
      geom_histogram(bins = 10, fill = "white", color = "black") +
      geom_vline(xintercept = 0, lty = 2, col = 2) +
      theme_bw()
    
    stock %>%
      summarize(mean_return = mean(return))
    ```
    
    ```{block, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
    It's hard to tell with the data if the broker did worse than average.
    
    Null hypothesis: The broker's average rate of return is 0.95%
    
    Alternative hypothesis: The broker's average rate of return is not 0.95%.
    ```
    
    ```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
    t.test(stock$return, mu = 0.95) %>%
      tidy() ->
      tout
    tout$p.value
    c(low = tout$conf.low, high = tout$conf.high)
    ```
    
    ```{block, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
    We have moderate evidence to suggest that the broker performs 
    worse than average.
    ```

# Pattern: Means of two groups are different (one quantitative, one binary)

- Example: Beaks depths were measured on Daphne Major finches in 1976 (before
  a harsh drought) and in 1978 (after a harsh drought). The researchers
  hypothesized that finches with deeper peaks were more likely to survive.
  
    ```{r}
    data("case0201")
    case0201 %>%
      mutate(Year = as.factor(Year)) ->
      finch
    glimpse(finch)
    ```

- Observational Units: The finches.

- Population: All finches.

- Sample: The 178 finches that the researches measured.

- Variables: The year the finch was measured (binary/categorical) and the
  beak depth (quantitative). Possible to also treat year as quantitative.
  
- Pattern: Use a boxplot to see if the groups differ.

    ```{r}
    ggplot(finch, aes(x = Year, y = Depth)) +
      geom_boxplot(coef = Inf) +
      geom_jitter(alpha = 1/3)
    ```

- Parameter of interest: Difference in mean beak depths between 1976 finches
  and 1978 finches.

- Estimate: The difference in mean beak depths between 1976 finches and 
  1978 finches in our sample.
  
    ```{r}
    finch %>%
      group_by(Year) %>%
      summarize(meandepth = mean(Depth)) %>%
      spread(key = Year, value = meandepth) %>%
      mutate(diff = `1978` - `1976`) ## do you remember why we need back-ticks?
    ```
  

- Hypothesis Test:
  - We want to know if the difference in the mean depths in the two years is
    actually different.
  - Two possibilities:
    - **Alternative Hypothesis**: The mean depths are different in the two years.
    - **Null Hypothesis**: The mean depths are the same in the two years. We
      just happened by chance to get deep 1978 finches and shallow 1976 finches.
    - Strategy: We calculate the probability of the data assuming possibility 2
      (called a p-value). If this probability is low, we conclude possibility 1.
      If the this probability is high, we don’t conclude anything.
      
- Graphic:
    
    ![](./cartoons/two_sample_p.png)\ 
    
- The distribution of possible null sample means comes from statistical theory.
  The t-statistic has a $t$ distribution with a complicated degrees of freedom.

- Function: `t.test()`. The quantitative variable goes to the left of the tilde
  and the binary variable goes to the right of the tilde.

    ```{r}
    tout <- t.test(Depth ~ Year, data = finch)
    tdf <- tidy(tout)
    tdf$estimate
    tdf$p.value
    ```
    
- `t.test()` also returns a 95% confidence interval for the difference in means.
  This has the exact same interpretation as in the previous section.
  
    ```{r}
    c(tdf$conf.low, tdf$conf.high)
    ```
    
- Assumptions (in decreasing order of importance):
  1. Independence: conditional on year, beak length of one finch doesn't
     give us any information on the beak lengths of any other finch.
  2. Approximate normality: The distribution of beak lengths is bell-curved 
     in each year. Doesn't matter for moderate-large sample sizes because of
     the central limit theorem.
     
- **Exercise**: The Armed Forces Qualifying Test is designed for evaluating
  suitability of military recruits. There are different subjects tested:
  arithmetic, word knowledge, paragraph comprehension, and mathematics. 
  They also provide a composite score. These data are stored in the
  `ex0222` data frame from the Sleuth3 package. For which subjects do we have
  evidence that the genders differ? Make appropriate exploratory plots, set up
  the appropriate hypotheses, and run appropriate hypothesis tests.
  
    ```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
    data("ex0222")
    afqt <- ex0222
    afqt %>%
      gather(-Gender, key = "Test", value = "Score") %>%
      ggplot(aes(x = Test, y = Score, fill = Gender)) +
      geom_boxplot() +
      scale_fill_colorblind()
    ```
    
    ```{block, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
    It seems possible that males do better on the arithmetic, math, and composite
    scores, while women do better at paragraph scores. 
    But the coefficient of variation seems very small. That is, the 
    variability within a gender is much larger than the variability between
    genders.
    ```
    
    ```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
    afqt %>%
      gather(-Gender, key = "Test", value = "Score") %>%
      group_by(Test) %>%
      nest() %>%
      mutate(ttest = map(data, ~tidy(t.test(Score ~ Gender, data = .)))) %>%
      unnest(ttest, .drop = TRUE) ->
      tout
    
    tout %>%
      select(Test, p.value, estimate) %>%
      knitr::kable()
    ```
    
    ```{block, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
    We have strong evidence that the genders differ in the arithmetic, paragraph,
    and math scores. We have moderate evidence of a difference in the AFQT scores.
    No evidence of a difference in word scores.
    ```
    
# Note on Assumptions of $t$-tools

- Assumptions of $t$-tools in decreasing order of importance:

    1. Independence: Knowing value of one observation does not tell you value of another.
    2. Normality: Distribution of quantitative variable (within each group) is normal.
  
- Hire a statistician if the independence assumption is violated.
  
- If data are *very* skewed (violating assumption 2) and the sample size is small
  and the quantitative variable is *always positive*, then take a log to make 
  the data more symmetric.
  
- Example: Seeded clouds with either silver iodide or a control substance. Measured rainfall.

    ```{r}
    data("case0301")
    ggplot(case0301, aes(x = Treatment, y = Rainfall)) +
      geom_boxplot()
    
    ggplot(case0301, aes(x = Treatment, y = Rainfall)) +
      geom_boxplot() +
      scale_y_log10()
    
    case0301 %>%
      mutate(logRainfall = log(Rainfall)) %>%
      t.test(logRainfall ~ Treatment, data = .) %>%
      tidy() ->
      tout
    ```

- Inference is then stated in terms of *medians* and *ratios of medians* since
  the log of the median is the median of the log (which is not true of means).
  Equivalently, the exponentiation of the median is equal to the median of the 
  exponentiation.
  Also, when data are symmetric, median = mean.
  
    - $\mu_1$ = mean of log-rainfall in seeded group = median of log-rainfall in seeded group.
    - $\mu_2$ = mean of log-rainfall in unseeded group = median of log-rainfall in unseeded group.    
    - $\mu_1 - \mu_2$ = difference in median log-rainfalls in two groups.
    - $e^{\mu_1 - \mu_2} = e^{\mu_1}/e^{\mu_2}$ = median rainfall in seeded group divided by median rainfall in unseeded group.
    - We estimate and get confidence intervals for $\mu_1 - \mu_2$, which implies we can estimate and get confidence intervals of $e^{\mu_1}/e^{\mu_2}$ by just exponentiating the output of `t.test()`.

- $p$-value:  
    ```{r}
    tout$p.value
    ```

- Estimate ratio of median rainfall in seeded group to median rainfall in 
  unseeded group:
  
    ```{r}
    exp(tout$estimate)
    ```

- Confidence interval for ratio of median rainfall in seeded group to median
  rainfall in unseeded group:
  
    ```{r}
    exp(c(low = tout$conf.low, high = tout$conf.high))
    ```
  
- **Exercise**: Read up on the `ex0330` dataset from the Sleuth3 R package. Determine
  if education level is associated with income. Interpret any estimates and
  confidence intervals you derive.
  
    ```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
    data("ex0330")
    ex0330 %>%
      mutate(Educ = factor(Educ)) ->
      educ
    
    educ %>%
      ggplot(aes(x = Income2005)) +
      facet_wrap(Educ ~ .) +
      geom_histogram(bins = 20)
    
    educ %>%
      ggplot(aes(x = Income2005)) +
      facet_wrap(Educ ~ .) +
      geom_histogram(bins = 20) +
      scale_x_log10()
    
    educ %>%
      mutate(logincome = log(Income2005)) ->
      educ
    
    educ %>%
      t.test(logincome ~ Educ, data = .) %>%
      tidy() ->
      tout
    
    ## strong evidence of assocation
    tout$p.value
    
    ## Estiamted ratio of median incomes between two groups
    exp(tout$estimate)
    
    ## So only having 12 years of education is estimated to have about 56% the median 
    ## income of a high-education individual with 95% confidence interval of:
    exp(c(low = tout$conf.low, high = tout$conf.high))
    ```
  

    
# Pattern: Proportion is shifted (one binary variable).

- Example: A 2013 Gallup poll (<https://news.gallup.com/poll/161198/favor-russian-nuclear-arms-reductions.aspx>)
  surveyed 1,028 U.S. adults. Of the respondents, 576 said they they support
  nuclear arms reduction
  
- Observational Units: U.S. adults

- Population: All U.S. adults.

- Sample: The 1028 U.S. adults in the survey.

- Variable: Did they support nuclear arms reduction (yes or no). This is a
  binary variable.
  
- Pattern: Calculate sample proportion.

    ```{r}
    576 / 1028
    ```

- Parameter of interest: Proportion of U.S. adults who support nuclear arms
  reduction.
  
- Estimate with sample proportion, 0.56.

- Hypothesis Testing:
  - We are interested in if more than half of U.S. adults support nuclear 
    arms reduction.
  - Two possibilities:
      1. **Alternative Hypothesis**: Proportion of U.S. adults who support 
         nuclear arms reduction is different from 0.5.
      2. **Null Hypothesis**: Proportion of U.S. adults who support 
         nuclear arms reduction is 0.5. We just happened *by chance* to get
         a sample proportion far from 0.5
  - Strategy: We calculate the probability of the data assuming possibility 2
    (called a *p*-value). If this probability is low, we conclude
    possibility 1. If this probability is high, we don't conclude anything.
    
- Graphic:

    ![](./cartoons/proptest_pvalue.png)\ 
    
- The distribution of possible null sample proportions comes from
  statistical theory. The number of successes has a binomial distribution
  with success probability 0.5 and size parameter equal to the 
  sample size. The sample proportion is the number successes divided by
  the sample size.

- Function: `prop.test()` (when you have a large number of both successes and
  failures) or `binom.test()` (for any number of successes and failures).
  
    ```{r}
    bout <- tidy(binom.test(x = 576, n = 1028, p = 0.5))
    bout %>%
      select(estimate, p.value, conf.low, conf.high)
    ```
    
    ```{r}
    pout <- tidy(prop.test(x = 576, n = 1028, p = 0.5))
    pout %>%
      select(estimate, p.value, conf.low, conf.high)
    ```
    
- **Exercise** (from OpenIntro): The 2010 General Social Survey asked 1,259
  US residents: "Do you think the use of marijuana should be made legal, or not?"
  48% of the respondents said it should be made legal.
    a. Is 48% a sample statistic or a population parameter? Explain.
    b. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of US residents 
       who think marijuana should be made legal, and interpret it in the 
       context of the data.
       
    ```{block, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
    For part a, 0.48 is a sample statistic.
    ```
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    binom.test(x = round(0.48 * 1259), n = 1259) %>%
      tidy() %>%
      select(conf.low, conf.high)
    ```

       

# Pattern: Two categorical variables are associated.

- Example: 86 lung cancer patients and 86 controls were interviewed on their
  smoking history in a 1954 study. The data can be found at: 
  <https://data-science-master.github.io/lectures/data/smoke.csv>.
    ```{r, message = FALSE}
    smoke <- read_csv(file = "../data/smoke.csv")
    glimpse(smoke)
    ```

- Usually, for two categorical variables, data are presented/provided in 
  two-way tables:
    ```{r}
    tabdat <- table(smoke$smoke, smoke$cancer)
    tabdat
    addmargins(tabdat)
    ```
    
- Or two-way tables of proportions.
    ```{r}
    prop.table(tabdat)
    ```

- Observational Units: People.

- Population: All people.

- Sample: The 172 people in the study.

- Variables: The smoking status of the person (`smoke`) and the cancer
  status of the person (`cancer`).
  
- Pattern: Visualize by calculating conditional proportions. For example, the 
  following code calculates the proportion of cancer cases that are smokers,
  and the proportion of controls that are smokers.
    ```{r}
    prop.table(tabdat, margin = 2)
    ```
    
- If you need a fancy plot for your boss, try a mosaic plot:

    ```{r}
    as.data.frame(tabdat) %>%
      ggplot(aes(y = Freq, x = Var2, fill = Var1)) +
      geom_col(position = "fill") +
      scale_fill_colorblind(name = "Smoking\nStatus") +
      xlab("Cancer Status") +
      ylab("Proportion")
    ```
    
- Intuition: If the two variables are not related, then we would expect about
  the same proportion of smokers in each group. But if these conditional 
  proportions are very different, then to variables might be related.
  
- Null hypothesis: cancer status and smoking status are independent.

- Alternative hypothesis: cancer status and smoking status are dependent.

- Function:`fisher.test()` tests for whether we see
  more smokers in one group versus the other. Or, symmetrically,
  whether we see more cancer cases in the smoker group versus the 
  nonsmoker group. We won't get into the test statistic or the null 
  distribution of this test.

    ```{r}
    tidy(fisher.test(tabdat)) %>%
      select(p.value, estimate)
    ```
    
- The value in the "estimate" column is the odds ratio. It's the multiplicative
  change in the odds of being a nonsmoker when you consider the cancer versus
  control groups. Specifically 
    $$
    \frac{3/86}{83/86} \div \frac{14/86}{72/86}
    $$
    
- You might see a chi-squared test in the wild. They are only appropriate
  for large numbers of counts in each cell. I don't see a reason to use it
  since we have computers, but it's fine most of the time to use:

    ```{r}
    tidy(chisq.test(tabdat)) %>%
      select(p.value)
    ```

- **Exercise**: Researches collected information on women 60 years old or older. 
  They asked them about their sexual activity and their coffee drinking status.
  Data are from: Diokno, Ananias C., Morton B. Brown, and A. Regula Herzog. 
  "Sexual function in the elderly." *Archives of Internal Medicine* 150, 
  no. 1 (1990): 197-200. The table is below:
  
    ```{r}
    tabdat <- as.table(matrix(c(15, 115, 25, 70), nrow = 2))
    dimnames(tabdat) <- list(coffee = c("yes", "no"), sex = c("yes", "no"))
    tabdat
    ```
  
    Does there appear to be an association between coffee drinking and 
    sexual activity? Create a table to explore this association. Then
    run a hypothesis test. What is the null hypothesis?
    
    ```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
    ## It seems like a very strong association.
    prop.table(tabdat, margin = 1)
    # Null hypothesis is independence.
    fisher.test(tabdat)
      ```
