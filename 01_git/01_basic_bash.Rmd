# Learning Objectives

- Open up the terminal.
- Basic shell commands.
- Chapter 4 of [Git for Scientists](https://milesmcbain.github.io/git_4_sci/).
- [Terminus](http://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html).

# The Command Line

- The **command line** is like the R command prompt: you insert code, hit enter,
  and then the computer executes your command.
  
- However, instead of inserting R code, you insert [Shell Script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script).
  
- In this class, we will use the command line primarily for two things:
    - Moving around your file system.
    - Running git commands.
  
- Other words for command line: shell, terminal, command line interface (cli), and console.
    - These terms are technically slightly 
      [different](https://askubuntu.com/questions/506510/what-is-the-difference-between-terminal-console-shell-and-command-line).
    
- There are many types of shells, each with their own scripting language. We will use the 
  [bash scripting language ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) 
  for this class.
  
- A huge difference between R and bash is how commands/functions are called.
    - R: `f(x, y = 1)`
    - Bash: `f x --y=1`
    - Arguments that are "flags" use only one dash, like `f x -g` would
      incorporate the `g` flag.

- If you are using Linux or Mac, then you can keep going. If you are using Windows, 
  you need to first download and install git (and thus git bash) from here:
  <http://git-scm.com/download/win>. You might need to restart R Studio if you
  are already running it.
  
- Open up the terminal
    - Windows: Open up the `Git Bash` app. It should look like this:
    
        <img src="./01_figs/git_bash.png" alt="Git Bash for Windows" width="50%"/>
        
    - Mac: On your Mac, do one of the following:
        - Click the Launchpad icon <img src="./01_figs/launchpad.png" alt="Mac Launchpad icon" width="20" height="20"> in the Dock, type Terminal in the search field, then click Terminal.
        - In the Finder <img src="./01_figs/finder.png" alt="Mac Finder Icon" width="20" height="20">, open the /Applications/Utilities folder, then double-click Terminal.
    - Ubuntu: Do one of the following
        - Open the dash and search for "terminal". Open up the terminal.
        - Use keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Alt+T
        - It should look like this:
        
            <img src="./01_figs/terminal_ubuntu.png" alt="Git Bash for Windows" width="50%"/>
    
- All commands get placed after the dollar sign.

- The path before the dollar sign is the working directory of the terminal, 
  **not** R's working directory. It's where the shell will reference all files 
  from.
  
- The tilde "`~`" is shorthand for the "home directory". Each computer has
  a home directory that is the "default directory".
  
# Useful Commands:
  
- `pwd`: Print working directory. Show the current working directory. This is like `getwd()` in R.

    ```{bash}
    pwd
    ```
    
- `ls`: List the current files and folders in a directory.

    ```{bash}
    ls
    ```

- `cd`: Change directories. This is like `setwd()` in R. As when we specified 
  paths in R, using two periods mean "move back a folder". 
  
    ```{bash}
    cd ../
    pwd
    ```
    
    - If you use `cd` without specifying a folder to move to, it will move the 
      working directory to the home directory.
  
    ```{bash}
    cd
    pwd
    ```

    - OK, I'm going to move us back to the 01_git directory.  

    ```{bash, eval=FALSE}
    cd ./Dropbox/teaching/data_496_696/lectures/01_git
    ```
    
- `man`: Read the manual of a command. Just like `help()` in R.

    ```{bash, eval=FALSE}
    man ls
    ```

    - This will open up the man page of `ls`. You can scroll through this page
      using the up and down arrows. You can exit this page by typing `q`.
      
    - This won't work for Git Bash (for Windows users). Instead, you'll need to type
        ```{bash, eval=FALSE}
        ls --help
        ```
      
- **Exercise**: What is your home directory? What files/folders exist in your 
  home directory? Navigate to it and then navigate back to your notes.
  
- **Exercise**: Where does the following command take you? How does it work?

    ```{bash, eval=FALSE}
    cd ~/../../..
    ```

- **Exercise**: Read the manual page of `ls`. What does the `a` flag do? 
  Try it out! 
  
# Other commands.

- `touch`: Create an empty file.

    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    touch empty_file.txt
    ```
    
- `more`: Open up a preview of a document. You can exit the preview by typeing `q`.

    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    more 01_basic_bash.Rmd 
    ```

- `cp`: Copy a file.

    ```{bash}
    cp 01_basic_bash.Rmd hellobash.Rmd
    ls
    ```

- `mv`: Move/rename a file.

    ```{bash}
    mv hellobash.Rmd goodbyebash.Rmd
    ls
    ```

- `rm`: Remove a file.

    ```{bash}
    rm goodbyebash.Rmd
    ls
    ```

- `mkdir`: Make a directory/folder.

    ```{bash}
    mkdir tempdir
    ls
    ```

- `rmdir`: Remove a directory/folder.

    ```{bash}
    rmdir tempdir
    ls
    ```

# String search with `grep`

Find any string in any file in the current working  directory (or subdirectories or the current working directory).

- `-r` recursive
- `-n` line number
- `-w` whole word only
- `-e` pattern
- `pdfgrep` (need to install separately) for searching text in PDFs.

```{bash}
grep -rnw -e "move"
```

```{bash}
grep -rnw -e "mov"
```

```{bash}
grep -rn -e "mov"
```

# Download data with `wget`

Non-interactive downloading of data.

Not available for Git Bash for Windows.

- `-nc` Don't download new copies if already there.
- `-nd` Put all files in current working directory.
- `-P` Tell where to download the files. Default is current working directory (`.`)
- `-r` Recursive downloading. Download all files in the directory up to a certain level.
- `l` Determine the level for recursive downloading.

E.g. to download the HTML file that contains the Wikipedia list of [theological demons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_theological_demons), we can go

```{bash}
wget -nc -nd https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_theological_demons
```

```{bash}
ls
```

I'll remove that file now

```{bash}
rm List_of_theological_demons
```

# Search your command history with `reverse-i-search`

1. `ctrl`+`r` to get search prompt
2. Type a search term
3. `ctrl`+`r` to cycle through matches
4. Hit `enter` if you want to reuse the match. Hit `ctrl`+`c` to exit out of the search.
