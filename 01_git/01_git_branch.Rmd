# Learning Objectives

- Learn the branch-commit-merge workflow for collaborative repos.
- [Understanding the GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
- [About branches](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-branches)
- [Resolving a merge conflict](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line)

# Motivation and Background

- We previously learned how to fork a repo. This allows you to collaborate on a repo that you don't own.

- You might also share a repo with someone. In this case, we use *branches* rather than forks.
  
- A branch is an "alternative universe" of your project, where you can experiment with new ideas (e.g. new data analyses, new data transformations, new statistical methods). After experimenting, you can then "merge" your changes back into the master branch.
  
- The "master" branch (the default in GitHub) is your best draft. You should consider anything in "master" as the best thing you've got.
  
- The workflow using branches consists of
    1. Create a branch with an informative title describing its goal(s).
    2. Add commits to this new branch.
    3. Merge the commits to master
    
- Create a new folder with a "README.md" file. This README should contain the
  following information:
  
    ```
    # Plot random data
    
    Generates 100 normal random variates and plots them using a histogram.
    ```
    
- You can create this README in the terminal with

    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    touch README.md
    ```
    
    and then edit it with your favorite text editor (mine is Emacs).

- Initialize a git repository in this folder and commit the README file
  as your first commit.
  
    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    git init
    git add --all
    git commit -m "Initial commit. Adds README"
    ```
  
- Open up GitHub and add a new repo called "random". Add the GitHub
  repo to the remotes and push your changes. My code was this (but yours
  will be different)
  
    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    git remote add origin git@github.com:dcgerard/random.git
    git push -u origin master
    ```
  
# Create a branch

- You create a branch with

    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    git branch <branch>
    ```
    
- We will create a branch called "norm_code", where we will add code to generate
  random normal variables.

    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    git branch norm_code
    ```

- You can see the list of branches (and the current branch) with
    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    git branch
    ```

# Move between branches

- You switch between branches with:

    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    git checkout <branch>
    ```
    
- Move to the norm_code branch with

    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    git checkout norm_code
    ```


# Edit Branch

- When you are on a branch, you can edit and commit as usual. Do this
  now by adding R code (in a new R file called "script.R") 
  to generate 100 random normal variables and plot
  them in a histogram.
  
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    set.seed(1)
    ```
      
    ```{r, message=FALSE}
    library(tidyverse)
    df <- tibble(x = rnorm(100))
    ggplot(df, aes(x = x)) +
      geom_histogram(bins = 20)
    ```
  
- Commit these changes.

- After you have committed these changes, push them to github with

    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    git push origin norm_code
    ```
    
- The above says to push our changes from norm_code (the branch on our computer)
  to origin (on GitHub).

# Merge into master

- You can merge branches by the command line, but I would recommend
  doing this on GitHub. Click on the button "Compare & pull request".
  
    ![](./01_figs/pull1.png)\

- Write an informative message. Then click "Create pull request".

- The following screen is a message board for discussing the pull request.
  After everyone is satisfied, you can click "Merge pull request".
    
    ![](./01_figs/pull3.png)\
    
- You can instead pull changes from master to the branch (for example, if
  someone else made some updates to master) by editing the direction
  of the pull request:
  
    ![](./01_figs/pull2.png)\
    
- You can pull the changes to master onto your local machine by going back
  to master and pulling:

    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    git checkout master
    git pull
    ```


# Resolving Merge Conflicts

- If two branches with incompatible histories try to merge, 
  then git does not merge them.

- Instead, it creates a "merge conflict", which you need to resolve.

- Instructions on resolving merge conflicts can be found here:
