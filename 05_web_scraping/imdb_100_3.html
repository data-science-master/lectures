To me, accuracy when making a Top 10/Top 100 all time list is extremely important. My lists are not based on my own personal favorites; they are based on the true greatness and/or success of the person, place or thing being ranked. In other words, a film's commercial success (Oscars &amp; BAFTA Awards), and greatness in direction, screenwriting and production, is how I ranked the films on this list. If you guys would like to view my other Top 10/Top 100 lists, feel free to check out my YouTube page and/or my IMDb page at *ChrisWalczyk55*.

Thanks guys and don't forget to LIKE &amp; comment! :)" data-id="main"><meta name="google-site-verification" content="0cadf7898134e79b"><meta name="msvalidate.01"

 movies on this list are ranked according to their success (awards &amp;
 nominations), their popularity, and their cinematic greatness from a 
directing/writing perspective. To me, accuracy when making a Top 10/Top 
100 all time list is extremely important. My lists are not based on my 
own personal favorites; they are based on the true greatness and/or 
success of the person, place or thing being ranked. In other words, a 
film's commercial success (Oscars &amp; BAFTA Awards), and greatness in 
direction, screenwriting and production, is how I ranked the films on 
this list. If you guys would like to view my other Top 10/Top 100 lists,
 feel free to check out my YouTube page and/or my IMDb page at
