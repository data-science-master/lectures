# StackExchange

- StackExchange has a page for describing authentication: <https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/authentication>

- It describes "server side applications" like posting stuff, and "client side applications" like reading stuff. We will use the "implicit" flow for reading stuff since that requires less security.

- Register for an app key here: <https://stackapps.com/users/login?returnurl=/apps/oauth/register>

```{r}
authorize_url <- "https://stackoverflow.com/oauth/dialog"
```
