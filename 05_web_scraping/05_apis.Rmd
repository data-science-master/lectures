# Learning Objectives

- APIs and R.
- [Chapter 1, 2, and 3 from An Introduction to APIs](https://zapier.com/learn/apis/).
- [Chapter 40 from STAT 545](https://stat545.com/diy-web-data.html).
- [API Package Best Practices](https://httr.r-lib.org/articles/api-packages.html).
- [Rectangling](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/rectangle.html)

# Data on the Web

- There are at least 4 ways people download data on the web:
    1. Click to download a csv/xls/txt file.
    2. Use a package that interacts with an API.
    3. Use an API directly.
    4. Scrape from directly from the HTML file.
    
- We know how to do 1.

- This lesson is about doing 2 and 3.

- Let's load the tidyverse:
    
    ```{r, message = FALSE}
    library(tidyverse)
    ```

# R Package API Wrappers

- API: Application Programming Interface
    - A description of how you can request data
      from a particular software, and a description of what 
      type of response you get after the request.
    - Usually, the data you get back are [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) 
      or [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) files.
    - API's are an abstraction and can be implemented in many languages.
    - Think of it like a user interface for a computer program. You click a button and expect 
      the user interface to do something. An API let's a program click a metaphorical 
      "button" and expect to get something back.
    - There are lots of free and public APIs: <https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis>

- Many of the most popular databases/websites have an R package that 
  wraps the API through R functions. 
    - I.e.: You can use an R function to request data.
    
- If an R package exists for an API, you should use it.
    
- Examples:
    - tidycensus: U.S. Census data API. 
        
        <https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus/>
        
    - twitteR: Twitter API.
    
        <http://geoffjentry.hexdump.org/twitteR.pdf>
        
    - gh: GitHub API.
    
        <https://github.com/r-lib/gh#readme>
        
    - wbstats: World Bank data.
    
        <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wbstats/vignettes/Using_the_wbstats_package.html>

    - rebird: Ebird dataset for bird sitings.
    
        <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rebird/vignettes/rebird_vignette.html>
        
    - geonames: Dataset containing unique names for geographic locations.
    
        <https://docs.ropensci.org/geonames/>
        
    - rplos: The PLoS journal articles.
    
        <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rplos/vignettes/rplos_vignette.html>
        
    - WikipediR: Wikipedia API:
    
        <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WikipediR/vignettes/WikipediR.html>
        
- Each package will be entirely unique, and you have to read its documentation
  to know how to download data. So we won't cover any of them.

- Example: The following will find all of the
  PLoS journal articles that contain the word "polyploid" in the abstract.
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    library(rplos)
    plout <- plosabstract("polyploid", limit = 1000)
    plout
    ```
  
# Use API's directly with httr

- The goal of this section is not to provide a comprehensive lesson on 
  HTTP and extracting data using API's. Rather, this is just to point you
  to some resources and give you some examples.
  
- Each API is different, and so you'll always have to figure out how to interact
  with a new API.

- API's always have documentation on what parameters you can send,
  how you can send them, and what data you would get back based on the 
  values of those parameters.
  
- E.g.: OMDB (an open-source version of IMDB) has a simple API <http://www.omdbapi.com/>

## API keys
- In order to access an API, you usually have to obtain an API key. 

- To obtain a free key from OMDB and access it in R:
    1. Sign up for a free key: <https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx>
    2. Open up your .Renviron file using the usethis package.
        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
        library(usethis)
        edit_r_environ()
        ```
    3. Add the key OMDB sent you by email to the .Renviron package. You can
       call it `OMDB_API_KEY`, for example. In which case you would write
       the following in .Renviron:
       
        ```
        OMDB_API_KEY = <your-private-key>
        ```

        Where "`<your-private-key>`" is the private key OMDB sent you by email.
    4. Restart R.
    5. You can now always access your private key by
        ```{r}
        movie_key <- Sys.getenv("OMDB_API_KEY")
        ```

- It is important to never save or display your private key in a file you could share. 
  You are responsible for all behavior associated with your key. That is
  why we saved it to our .Renviron and are only accessing it secretly through
  `Sys.getenv()`.
  
- It is still not great that your key is in a plain text environment. You
  can add a layer of security by using the keyring package: <https://github.com/r-lib/keyring>
  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    library(keyring)
    key_set("OMDB_API_KEY_SECURE") ## do this once to save the key
    movie_key_2 <- key_get("OMDB_API_KEY_SECURE") ## do this each time you need the key
    ```
    
    A person with access to your computer who knows R and the keyring package
    could still get to your key. But it is more secure than placing your
    key in a plain text file (which is what .Renviron is). There are
    more secure ways to access keys in R.
    
### Basic Authentication

- Other API's use what's called "Basic" authentation, where you provide
  a username and password. The basic syntax for this is:
  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    GET("url", authenticate("username", "password"))
    ```

- You should already have a username and password set up. Again, I would
  suggest keeping your password secure using your .Renviron file or keyring.
  
## httr

- Most API's on the web use HTTP (Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol). It's a 
  language for querying and obtaining data.

- We won't learn HTTP, but we will use R's interface for HTTP through the
  httr package.
  
    ```{r}
    library(httr)
    ```

- The major function we will use is `GET()`, which fetches data.

- There are many other function in httr used to interact with API's.

- Let's use `GET()` to fetch the movie information on 
  [The Lighthouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lighthouse_(2019_film)).
    ```{r}
    mout <- GET(url = "http://www.omdbapi.com/",
                query = list(t = "The Lighthouse",
                             plot = "short", 
                             r = "json", 
                             apikey = movie_key))
    ```
    
- The `url` argument is the URL where all API requests should be sent. This
  is usually documents in the API documentation. In our case, OMDB says
  to send all requests to "http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=[yourkey]&". The
  terms after `?` are queries, so I just used the base URL.
  
- The variable after `?` indicates that `apikey` is a query, so I included
  that in the list of queries.
    
- You use the `query` argument to modify the parameters of your request. 
  It needs to be a named list where the names are the parameters that
  you get from the API documentation.
  
- Other API's use headers or body information instead of queries to modify requests. 
  See <https://httr.r-lib.org/articles/api-packages.html#first-steps>
  
    1. URL path: the `path` argument in `GET()`.
    2. Query arguments: The `query` argument in `GET()`.
    3. HTTP headers: `add_headers()`
    4. Request body: The body argument in `GET()`.
  
- In the API documentation:

    ![](./cartoons/OMDB_API_DOC.png)\ 
    
- The *status code* describes whether your request was successful.
    - List of codes: <https://www.flickr.com/photos/girliemac/sets/72157628409467125>
    - Use `status_code()` to get the code for our request:
        ```{r}
        status_code(mout)
        ```
        
- *Headers* provide infromation on the request. Use the `headers()` function
  to see what headers we got in our request.
  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    headers(mout)
    ```
  
- The *body* contains the data you are probably most interested in. Use
  `content()` to access the body:
  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    content(mout)
    ```
  
- Background: The body comes in the form of either a JSON or XML data structure.
  `content()` will parse this into an R object (usually a list). You can see
  the raw JSON data structure here with the `as = "text"` argument:
  
    ```{r}
    content(mout, as = "text")
    ```

## Rectangling

- The format for the data you typically get from an API is a list of lists.

- The `repurrrsive` package contains a few examples.

    ```{r}
    library(repurrrsive)
    ```

- The dataset `gh_users` contains information from 6 users, obtained using GitHub's API: <https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-a-single-user>

    ```{r}
    data("gh_users")
    typeof(gh_users)
    length(gh_users)
    names(gh_users[[1]])
    ```

- There are a few functions from `tidyr` package that can be used to "unnest" a list into a data frame.

    - `unnest_wider()`: Each list element becomes its own column
    - `hoist()`: Similar as `unnest_wider()`, but you can choose what elements to extract to their own columns.
    - `unnest_longer()`: Each list element becomes its own row.

- Because this is the tidyverse, your list needs to be a column in a data frame:

    ```{r}
    df <- tibble(users = gh_users)
    df
    ```

- In which case, you can consider the unnest functions via:

    - `unnest_wider()` preserves the rows, but changes the columns.
    - `unnest_longer()` preserves the columns, but changes the rows
    
- Use `unnest_wider()` to make each of those list elements their own column.

    ```{r}
    unnest_wider(df, users)
    ```

- Graphic:

    ![](./cartoons/unnest_wider.png)\ 
    
- Use `hoist()` to only extract some elements of a list:

    ```{r}
    df2 <- hoist(df, users, 
                 login = "login",
                 follows = "follows")
    df2
    ```
    
- Notice that the new data frame still has a list column, but each each list now only has 28 elements instead of 30. That's because `hoist()` has removed the `login` and `follows` elements from each list in the list column.

    ```{r}
    df2$users[[1]]$login
    df2$users[[1]]$follows
    ```

- Graphic:

    ![](./cartoons/hoist.png)\ 
    

- Let's look at the list `gh_repos`, which was also obtained using the GitHub API: <https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#list-user-repositories>

    ```{r}
    data("gh_repos")
    typeof(gh_repos)
    length(gh_repos)
    df <- tibble(repo = gh_repos)
    df
    ```

- This list is very complicated!

    ![](./cartoons/github_repos.png)\ 
    
- Ideally, each repo would be its own row (since the repositories are the observational units). We can do this with `unnest_longer()`.

    ```{r}
    df2 <- unnest_longer(df, repo)
    df2
    ```

- Graphic:

    ![](./cartoons/unnest_longer.png)\ 
    
- We can then use `unnest_wider()` or `hoist()` on this new data frame to get a tidy dataset.

    ```{r}
    df3 <- unnest_wider(df2, repo)
    df3
    ```

- Graphic:

    ![](./cartoons/unnest_wider_2.png)\ 
    

- **Exercise**: Clean up the `sw_people` list from the `repurrrsive` package:

    ```{r}
    library(repurrrsive)
    data("sw_people")
    ```
    
    ```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
    tibble(people = sw_people) %>%
      unnest_wider(people)
    ```
  
- **Exercise**: Clean up the `got_chars` list from the `repurrrsive` package

    ```{r}
    library(repurrrsive)
    data("got_chars")
    ```
    
    ```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
    tibble(chars = got_chars) %>%
      unnest_wider(chars)
    ```

- **Exercise**: Consider the Studio Ghibli API: <https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/#tag/Films%2Fpaths%2F~1films%2Fget>

    Extract all of the films from this API and clean the data. Your final data frame should look like this:

    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    library(httr)
    url <- modify_url(url = "https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films", 
                      query = list(limit = 250))
    gout <- GET(url = url)
    glist <- content(gout)
    tibble(film = glist) %>%
      unnest_wider(film)
    ```
