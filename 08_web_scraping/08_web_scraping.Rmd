# Learning Objectives

- Basics of Web Scraping
- [Overview of rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/).
- [SelectorGadget](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/selectorgadget.html).
- [rvest tutorial](http://bradleyboehmke.github.io//2015/12/scraping-html-text.html)
- [HTML tables](http://bradleyboehmke.github.io/2015/12/scraping-html-tables.html).

# Data on the Web

- There are at least 4 ways people download data on the web:
    1. Click to download a csv/xls/txt file.
    2. Use a package that interacts with an API.
    3. Use an API directly.
    4. Scrape from directly from the HTML file.
    
- This lesson, we talk about how to do 4.

- Note that you shouldn't download thousands of HTML files from a website
  to parse --- the admins might block you if you send too many requests.

- Let's load the tidyverse:
    
    ```{r, message = FALSE}
    library(tidyverse)
    ```

# CSS

- We have to know a little bit about CSS in order to understand how to extract
  certain elements from a website.
  
- CSS stands from "Cascading Style Sheets". It's a formatting language that
  indicates how HTML files should look. Every website you have been on is formatted
  with CSS.
  
- Here is some example CSS:

    ``` css
    h3 {
      color: red;
      font-style: italic;
    }
    
    footer div.alert {
      display: none;
    }
    ```
    
- The part before the curly braces is called a *selector*. It corresponds
  to HTML tags. Specifically, for those two they would correspond to:
  
    ``` html
    <h3>Some text</h3>
    
    <footer>
    <div class="alert">More text</div>
    </footer>
    ```
    
- The code inside the curly braces are *properties*. For example, the h3
  properties tells us to make the h3 headers red and in italics. The second
  CSS chunk says that all `<div>` tags of class `"alert"` in the `<footer>`
  should be hidden.
  
- CSS applies the same *properties* to the same *selectors*. So every time
  we use h3 will result in the h3 styling of red and italicized text.

# SelectorGadget

- SelectorGadget is a tool for you to see what selector influences 
  a particular element on a website.

- To install SelectorGadget, drag this link to your bookmark bar on Chrome: [SelectorGadget](javascript:(function()%7Bvar%20s=document.createElement('div');s.innerHTML='Loading...';s.style.color='black';s.style.padding='20px';s.style.position='fixed';s.style.zIndex='9999';s.style.fontSize='3.0em';s.style.border='2px%20solid%20black';s.style.right='40px';s.style.top='40px';s.setAttribute('class','selector_gadget_loading');s.style.background='white';document.body.appendChild(s);s=document.createElement('script');s.setAttribute('type','text/javascript');s.setAttribute('src','https://dv0akt2986vzh.cloudfront.net/unstable/lib/selectorgadget.js');document.body.appendChild(s);%7D)();)

- Suppose we wanted to get the top 100 movies of all time from IMDB. The
  web page is very unstructured:
  
    <https://www.imdb.com/list/ls055592025/>
    
    ![](./cartoons/IMDB_100_1.png)\ 
    
    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    If the above link fails, try: <https://data-science-master.github.io/lectures/08_web_scraping/imdb_100.html>
    ```
    
- If we click on the ranking of the Godfather, the "1" turns green (indicating
  what we have selected).
  
    ![](./cartoons/IMDB_100_2.png)\ 
  
- The ".text-primary" is the selector associated with the "1" we clicked on.

- Everything highlighted in yellow also has the ".text-primary" selector
  associated with it.
  
- We will also want the name of the movie. So if we click on that
  we get the selector associated with both the rank and the movie name:
  "a , .text-primary".
  
    ![](./cartoons/IMDB_100_3.png)\ 
  
- But we also got a lot of stuff we don't want (in yellow). If we click
  one of the yellow items that we don't want, it turns red. This indicates
  that we don't want to select it.
  
    ![](./cartoons/IMDB_100_4.png)\ 

- Only the ranking and the name remain, which are under the selector 
  ".lister-item-header a , .text-primary".
  
- It's important to visually inspect the selected elements throughout the whole
  HTML file. SelectorGadget doesn't always get all of what you want, or
  it sometimes gets too much.
  
- **Exercise**: What selector can we use to get just the genres of each film,
  the metacritic score, and the IMDB rating?
  
    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    ".ipl-rating-star.small .ipl-rating-star__rating , .ratings-metascore, .genre"
    ```
  
# Chrome developer tools:

- If you have trouble with SelectorGadget, you can also use the Chrome
  developer tools.
  
- Open up the list of selectors with: &#8942; > More tools > Developer tools.
  
- Clicking on the element selector on the top left of the developer tools
  will show you what selectors are possible with each element.
  
    ![](./cartoons/IMDB_100_6.png)\ 
  
# rvest

- We'll use rvest to extract elements from HTML files.

    ```{r, message = FALSE}
    library(rvest)
    ```

- Use `read_html()` to save an HTML file to a variable. The variable will
  be an "`xml_document`" object

    ```{r}
    html_obj <- read_html("https://www.imdb.com/list/ls055592025/")
    html_obj
    class(html_obj)
    ```
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    html_obj <- read_html("./imdb_100.html")
    ```
    
- [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) stands for 
  "Extensible Markup Language". It's a markup language 
  (like HTML and Markdown), useful for representing data.
  rvest will store the HTML file as an XML.

- We can use `html_nodes()` and the selectors we found in the previous section 
  to get the elements we want. Insert the found selectors as the `css`
  argument.
  
    ```{r}
    ranking_elements <- html_nodes(html_obj, css = ".lister-item-header a , .text-primary")
    head(ranking_elements)
    ```

- To extract the text inside the obtained nodes, use `html_text()`:

    ```{r}
    ranking_text <- html_text(ranking_elements)
    head(ranking_text)
    ```
    
- After you do this, you need to tidy the data using your data munging 
  tools.
  
    ```{r}
    tibble(text = ranking_text) %>%
      mutate(rownum = row_number(),
             iseven = rownum %% 2 == 0,
             movie = rep(1:100, each = 2)) %>%
      select(-rownum) %>%
      spread(key = "iseven", value = "text") %>%
      select(-movie, "Rank" = "FALSE", movie = "TRUE") %>%
      mutate(Rank = parse_number(Rank)) ->
      movierank
    movierank
    ```
  
- **Exercise**: Extract the directors and the names of each film. You can
  extract them separately and combine them.
  
    ```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
    dirdat <- html_nodes(html_obj, ".text-small a:nth-child(1)")
    dirdat <- html_text(dirdat)
    dirdat <- dirdat[-1] ## got an extra one
    filmdat <- html_nodes(html_obj, ".lister-item-header a")
    filmdat <- html_text(filmdat)
    
    data.frame(film = filmdat, director = dirdat)
    ```
  
# Bigger example using rvest
  
- Let's try and get the name, rank, year, genre, and metascore for each 
  movie:
  
    ![](./cartoons/IMDB_100_5.png)\ 
  
- We copy the CSS selectors and make a text vector

    ```{r}
    dataobj <- html_nodes(html_obj, css = ".favorable , .genre, .unbold, .lister-item-header a")
    datatext <- html_text(dataobj)
    ```
  
- We now have a *lot* of cleaning to do. Note that the first 132 elements
  we didn't even want:
    ```{r}
    head(datatext)
    datatext[130:136]
    ```
  
  
- The rankings are always of the form `"\\d+\\."`. We'll use this and a
  cumulative sum to indicate which movies the variables belong to.
  This is necessary because some data have elements that are missing (e.g. 
  "The Great Dictator" doesn't have a metacritic score).

    ```{r}
    datadf <- tibble(text = datatext)
    
    datadf %>%
      mutate(ismovierank = str_detect(text, "^\\d+\\.$")) ->
      datadf
    
    ## make sure it is 100
    sum(datadf$ismovierank)
    
    ## get movie numbers and remove non-movie elements:
    datadf %>%
      mutate(movienum = cumsum(ismovierank)) %>%
      filter(movienum > 0) ->
      datadf
    
    datadf
    ```

- We'll use the `movierank$movie` variable we created before see
  which rows are movie names
  
    ```{r}
    datadf %>%
      mutate(isname = text %in% movierank$movie) ->
      datadf
    
    ## make sure we have 100 movies:
    sum(datadf$isname)
    
    datadf
    ```
    
- Years are surrounded by parentheses:

    ```{r}
    datadf %>%
      mutate(isyear = str_detect(text, "\\(\\d+\\)")) ->
      datadf
    
    ## make sure it is 100
    sum(datadf$isyear)
    
    datadf
    ```

- Genre's begin with a new line:
    
    ```{r}
    datadf %>%
      mutate(isgenre = str_detect(text, "^\\n")) ->
      datadf
    
    ## make sure it is 100
    sum(datadf$isgenre)
    ```

- Everything else should be the metacritic score:

    ```{r}
    datadf %>%
      group_by(ismovierank, isname, isyear, isgenre) %>%
      count()
    
    datadf %>%
      mutate(ismeta = !ismovierank & !isname & !isyear & !isgenre) ->
      datadf
    
    datadf
    ```

- Let's create a key for these data then spread them:

    ```{r}
    datadf %>%
      mutate(key = case_when(ismovierank ~ "rank",
                             isname ~ "name",
                             isyear ~ "year",
                             isgenre ~ "genre",
                             ismeta ~ "metacritic")) %>%
      select(key, text, movienum) %>%
      spread(key = "key", value = "text") ->
      datawide
    
    datawide
    ```
    
- Let's clean up the remaining variables:

    ```{r}
    datawide %>%
      mutate(genre = str_replace_all(genre, "\\n", ""),
             genre = str_squish(genre),
             metacritic = parse_number(metacritic),
             rank = parse_number(rank),
             year = parse_number(year)) ->
      datawide
    
    datawide
    ```

# `html_table()`

- When data is in the form of a table, you can format it more easily with
  `html_table()`.

- The Wikipedia article on hurricanes: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane_season>

    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    If the above link fails, try: <https://data-science-master.github.io/lectures/08_web_scraping/wiki.html>
    ```
    
    This contains many tables which might be a pain to copy and paste
    into Excel (and we would be prone to error if we did so).
    Let's try to automate this procedure.
  
- Save the HTML

    ```{r}
    wikixml <- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane_season")
    ```
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    wikixml <- read_html("./wiki.html")
    ```
    
- We'll extract all of the "table" elements.

    ```{r}
    wikidat <- html_nodes(wikixml, "table")
    ```

- Use `html_table()` to get a list of tables from table elements:

    ```{r}
    tablist <- html_table(wikidat, fill = TRUE)
    class(tablist)
    length(tablist)
    tablist[[19]] %>%
      select(1:4)
    ```
    
- You can clean up, bind, or merge these tables after you have read them in.

- **Exercise**: The Wikipedia page on the oldest mosques in the world
  has many tables. 
  
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_oldest_mosques>
    
    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    If the above link fails, try: <https://data-science-master.github.io/lectures/08_web_scraping/mosque.html>
    ```
  
    1. Use rvest to read these tables into R.
    2. Use rvest and SelectorGadget to extract out the category for the 
       table (mentioned in Quran, in northeast Africa, etc).
    3. Merge the data frames together. You only need to keep the building
       name, the country, and the time it was first build. 
       
    *Hint*: It's easier if you use a css selector of `"table.wikitable"`
    to get the table rather than just `"table"`. I found this out by getting
    to the developer tools in Chrome with CTRL + Shift + I then playing around
    with the tables.
    
    The first 15 rows should look like this:
       
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    mosque <- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_oldest_mosques")
    ```
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    mosque <- read_html("mosque.html")
    ```
    
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    headers <- html_text(html_nodes(mosque, css = "caption , #Mentioned_in_the_Quran"))
    tabnode  <- html_nodes(mosque, css = "table.wikitable")
    tablist <- html_table(tabnode, fill = TRUE)
    
    ## length(tablist)
    ## length(headers)
    
    ## See what variables are in each table
    ## map(tablist, names)
    
    ## Table 18 doesn't have a country
    ## headers[[18]]
    tablist[[18]] %>%
      mutate(Country = "Russia") ->
      tablist[[18]]
    
    ## table 13 has an NA row
    names(tablist[[13]])[ncol(tablist[[13]])] <- "blah"
    
    ## select variables of interest
    map(tablist, ~select(., Building, Country, fb = `First built`)) ->
      tablist
    
    ## replace, e.g., 15th century with 1500 century
    map(tablist, ~mutate(., fb = str_replace(fb, "th", "00"))) %>%
      map(~mutate(., fb = str_extract(fb, "^\\d+"))) ->
      tablist
    
    ## clean up headers
    str_replace_all(headers, "\\n", "") %>%
      str_replace_all("\\(.+\\)", "") %>%
      str_squish() ->
      headers
    
    ## add category information    
    for (index in seq_along(tablist)) {
      mutate(tablist[[index]], category = headers[[index]]) ->
        tablist[[index]]
    }
    
    ## bind rows
    bind_rows(tablist) ->
      tabdf
    
    ## print
    head(tabdf, n = 15)
    ```
