- World Bank Data: The World Bank is an international organization that
  provides loans to countries with the goal of reducing poverty. The following
  data frames were all taken from the public data repositories of the World
  Bank.
    - [country.csv](./data/country.csv): 
      Contains information on the countries in the data set. The
      variables are:
        - `Country_Code`: A three-letter code for the country. Note that not all
          rows are countries; some are regions.
        - `Region`: The region of the country.
        - `IncomeGroup`: Either `"High income"`, `"Upper middle income"`, 
          `"Lower middle income"`, or `"Low income"`.
        - `TableName`: The full name of the country.
    - [fertility.csv](./data/fertility.csv): 
      Contains the fertility rate information for each country
      for each year. For the variables `1960` to `2017`, the values in the cells
      represent the fertility rate in total births per woman for the that year. 
      Total fertility rate represents the number of children 
      that would be born to a woman if she were to live to the end of her 
      childbearing years and bear children in accordance with age-specific 
      fertility rates of the specified year.
    - [life_exp.csv](./data/life_exp.csv): 
      Contains the life expectancy information for each country 
      for each year. For the variables `1960` to `2017`, the values in the cells
      represent life expectancy at birth in years for the given year. 
      Life expectancy at birth indicates the number of years a newborn 
      infant would live if prevailing patterns of mortality at the time of its
      birth were to stay the same throughout its life.
    - [population.csv](./data/population.csv): 
      Contains the population information for each country. For
      the variables `1960` to `2017`, the values in the cells represent the total
      population in number of people for the given year. 
      Total population is based on the de facto definition of
      population, which counts all residents regardless of legal status or 
      citizenship. The values shown are midyear estimates.
