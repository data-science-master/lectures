- [airfares.csv](./data/airfares.csv): Average first quarter domestic airline
  fares by origin airport for major U.S. airports from 1993 to 2019. The
  data are from The Bureau of Transportation Statistics 
  (<https://www.transtats.bts.gov/AverageFare/>). Variables include:

  - `city`: The city of the origin airport.
  - `state`: The state of the origin airport.
  - `fare`: Average first quarter fare from the origin airport in a given year.
    "Fares are based on the total ticket value which consists of the price 
    charged by the airlines plus any additional taxes and fees levied by an 
    outside entity at the time of purchase. Fares include only the price paid 
    at the time of the ticket purchase and do not include other fees, such as 
    baggage fees, paid at the airport or onboard the aircraft. Averages do not
    include frequent-flyer or 'zero fares' or a few abnormally high reported 
    fares."
  - `adj_fare`: Inflation adjusted average fare (in 2019 dollars). 
    "The inflation adjustment was performed using Consumer Price Index 
    for all urban consumers."

  Big Mac for each country during this time. It also contains the data on the
  implied [purchasing power parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity)
  using Big Mac prices. Specifically, the variables are of the form:

- [bob.csv](./data/bob.csv): [Bob Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross) 
  was a painter who hosted a popular television series on PBS. Each episode 
  would consist of him completing an entire painting. His paintings almost 
  always consisted heavily of elements from nature: trees, clouds, mountains, 
  lakes, etc. These data consist of indicators for what elements are in each 
  episode. This dataset was taken from the excellent crew at
  [fivethirtyeight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/bob-ross). 
  See [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-statistical-analysis-of-the-work-of-bob-ross/) 
  for their article. The data were obtained using
  [this](https://github.com/dcgerard/stat234/blob/master/analysis/clean_datasets/bob_ross/get_bob.R) 
  code. The variables are:
    - `EPISODE`: The season and episode number of the episode.
    - `TITLE`: The title of the painting.
    - Every other variable is an indicator for whether the episode contains 
      the element described by the variable name. For example, `BARN` 
      is `0` if the episode does not have a barn in the painting and `1` if the 
      episode does have a barn in the painting.

      multiple days spanning multiple months then the format is 
      "month_start day_start - month_end day_end, year". If it took place over
      multiple days spanning multiple years then the format is
      "month_start day_start, year_start - month_end day_end, year_end".
    - `State`: The state where the battle took place. Annotations (e.g. 
      describing that the state was a territory at the time) are in parentheses.

      `"Inconclusive"`, followed by notes.

      for each year. For the variables `1960` to `2017`, the values in the cells

      childbearing years and bear children in accordance with age-specific 
      fertility rates of the specified year.

      for each year. For the variables `1960` to `2017`, the values in the cells
      represent life expectancy at birth in years for the given year. 
      Life expectancy at birth indicates the number of years a newborn 
      infant would live if prevailing patterns of mortality at the time of its
      birth were to stay the same throughout its life.
    - [population.csv](./data/population.csv): 
      Contains the population information for each country. For
