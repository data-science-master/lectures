# For Loops

- Load the tidyverse

    ```{r, message=FALSE}
    library(tidyverse)
    ```


- *Iteration* is the repetition of some amount of code.

- If we didn't know the `sum()` function, how would we add up the elements
  of a vector?
  
    ```{r}
    x <- c(8, 1, 3, 1, 3)
    ```
  
- We could manually add the elements.
    ```{r}
    x[1] + x[2] + x[3] + x[4] + x[5]
    ```

    But this is prone to error (through copy and paste). Also, what if `x` has
    10,000 elements?

- For loops to the rescue!    
    ```{r}
    sumval <- 0
    for (i in seq_along(x)) {
       sumval <- sumval + x[[i]]
    }
    sumval
    ```
    
- Each for loop contains the following elements:

    1. **Output**: This is `sumval` above. We allocate the space for the output 
       *before* the for loop.
    2. **Sequence**: This is `seq_along(x)` above, which evaluates to `1 2 3 4 5`.
       These are the values that `i` will go through each iteration.
    3. **Body**: This is the code between the curly braces `{}`. This is the code
       that will be evaluated each iteration with a new value of `i`.

- In the above sequence, R internally transforms the code to:

    ```{r}
    sumval <- 0
    sumval <- sumval + x[[1]]
    sumval <- sumval + x[[2]]
    sumval <- sumval + x[[3]]
    sumval <- sumval + x[[4]]
    sumval <- sumval + x[[5]]
    sumval
    ```

- You often want to fill a vector with values. You should create this vector
  beforehand using the `vector()` function.

- For example, let's calculate a vector of cumulative sums of `x`.
    ```{r}
    cumvec <- vector(mode = "double", length = length(x))
    cumvec
    for (i in seq_along(cumvec)) {
       if (i == 1) {
         cumvec[[i]] <- x[[i]]
       } else {
         cumvec[[i]] <- cumvec[[i - 1]] + x[[i]] 
       }
    }
    cumvec
    
    ## Same as cumsum(x)
    cumsum(x)
    ```
  

- **Exercise**: The first two numbers of the 
  [Fibonacci Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)
  are 0 and 1. Each succeeding number is the sum of the previous two numbers in 
  the sequence. For example, the third element is 1 = 0 + 1, while the fourth
  elements is 2 = 1 + 1, and the fifth element is 3 = 2 + 1. Use a for loop to
  calculate the first 100 Fibonacci Numbers. Sanity Check: The $\log_2$ of the 100th 
  Fibonacci Number is about 67.57.
  
    ```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
    fibvec <- vector(mode = "double", length = 100)
    for (i in seq_along(fibvec)) {
      if (i > 2) {
        fibvec[[i]] <- fibvec[[i - 1]] + fibvec[[i - 2]]
      } else if (i == 1) {
        fibvec[[i]] <- 0 
      } else if (i == 2) {
        fibvec[[i]] <- 1
      } else {
        stop(paste0("i = ", i))
      }
    }
    head(fibvec, n = 10)
    ```
  

- Looping is often done over the columns of a data frame. 

- Note: for a 
  data frame `df`, `seq_along(df)` is the same as `1:ncol(df)` which is the
  same as `1:length(df)` (since data frames are special cases of lists).

- Let's calculate the mean of each column of `mtcars`
    ```{r}
    data("mtcars")
    mean_vec <- vector(mode = "numeric", length = length(mtcars))
    for (i in seq_along(mtcars)) {
      mean_vec[[i]] <- mean(mtcars[[i]], na.rm = TRUE)   
    }
    mean_vec
    colMeans(mtcars)
    ```
    
- Why not just use `colMeans()`? Well, there is no "`colSDs`" function, so iteration is 
  important for applying non-implemented functions to multiple elements in R.


- **Exercise**: Use a for loop to calculate the standard deviation of each penguin
  trait in the `penguins` data frame from the `palmerpenguins` package.
  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    library(palmerpenguins)
    data("penguins")
    sdvec <- rep(NA, length = length(penguins))
    for (i in seq_along(penguins)) {
      if (is.numeric(penguins[[i]])) {
        sdvec[[i]] <- sd(penguins[[i]], na.rm = TRUE)
      }
    }
    sdvec
    ```

# purrr

## Basic Mappings

- R is a functional programming language. Which means that you can pass
  functions to functions.
  
- Suppose on `mtcars` we want to calculate the column-wise mean, the column-wise
  median, the column-wise standard deviation, the column-wise maximum, the 
  column-wise minimum, and the column-wise
  [MAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_absolute_deviation). The for-loop
  would look very similar
  
    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    funvec <- rep(NA, length = length(mtcars))
    for (i in seq_along(funvec)) {
      funvec[i] <- fun(mtcars[[i]], na.rm = TRUE) 
    }
    funvec
    ```
    
- Ideally, we would like to just tell R what function to apply to each column
  of `mtcars`. This is what the purrr package allows us to do.
  
- purrr is a part of the tidyverse, and so does not need to be loaded 
  separately.
  
- `map_*()` takes a vector (or list or data frame) as input, applies a provided
  function on each element of that vector, and outputs a vector of the same 
  length.
    
    - `map()` returns a list.
    - `map_lgl()` returns a logical vector.
    - `map_int()` returns an integer vector.
    - `map_dbl()` returns a double vector.
    - `map_chr()` returns a character vector.
  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    map_dbl(mtcars, mean)
    map_dbl(mtcars, median)
    map_dbl(mtcars, sd)
    map_dbl(mtcars, mad)
    map_dbl(mtcars, min)
    map_dbl(mtcars, max)
    ```
  
- You can pass on more arguments in `map_*()`.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    map_dbl(mtcars, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
    ```

- Suppose you want to get the output of `summary()` on each column.
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    map(mtcars, summary)
    ```

- **Exercise** (RDS 21.5.3.1): Write code that uses one of the map functions to:

    1. Determine the type of each column in `nycflights13::flights.`
    2. Compute the number of unique values in each column of `palmerpenguins::penguins`.
    3. Generate 10 random normals for each of $\mu = -10, 0, 10, \ldots, 100$.
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    library(nycflights13)
    library(palmerpenguins)
    data("flights")
    data("penguins")
    map_chr(flights, typeof)
    map_int(penguins, function(x) length(unique(x)))
    map_dfc(seq(-10, 100, by = 10), rnorm, n = 10) ->
      temp
    ```

## Shortcuts

- Instead of specifying a built-in funciton, you can create an anonymous function to map over.

- Anonymous functions are non-named functions that are used as inputs to other functions.

- Typically,t hey are one-liners and are of the form

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    function(args) code-using-args
    ```

- E.g., an anonymous function that outputs the interquartile range of a vector is

    ```{r}
    function(x) quantile(x, 0.75) - quantile(x, 0.25)
    ```

- R 4.0 and above allows for a shorter syntax for anonymous functions.

    ```{r}
    \(x) quantile(x, 0.75) - quantile(x, 0.25)
    ```

- For example, the following are three equivalent ways to calculate the mean
  of each column in `mtcars`.
  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    map_dbl(mtcars, mean)
    map_dbl(mtcars, function(x) mean(x))
    map_dbl(mtcars, \(x) mean(x))
    ```
    
- You can think about this as purrr creating an anonymous function

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    .f <- function(.) {
      mean(.)
    }
    ```

    and then calling this function in `map()`.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    map_dbl(mtcars, .f)
    ```
  

- Why is this useful? Consider the following chunk of code which allows us to
  fit many simple linear regression models:

    ```{r}
    mtcars |>
      nest(.by = cyl) |>
      mutate(lmout = map(data, \(df) lm(mpg ~ wt, data = df))) ->
      sumdf
    ```
      
    - `nest(.by = cyl)` will create a new data frame containing a list column of data frames, where each data frame has the same value of `cyl` for all units within that data frame.
    - `\(df) lm(mpg ~ wt, data = df)` defines a function (called an 
      "anonymous function") that will fit a linear model of `mpg` on `wt` 
      where those variables are in the data frame `df`.
    - The `map()` call fits that linear model to each of the three data frames
      in the list-column called `data` created by `nest()`.
    - What is returned is a data frame containing a new list column called `lmout` that contains the three `lm` objects that you can use to get fits and summaries.
      
    ```{r}
    summary(sumdf$lmout[[1]])
    ```
  
- We can use `map()` to get a list of summaries.
    ```{r}
    sumdf |>
      mutate(sumlm = map(lmout, summary)) ->
      sumdf
    
    sumdf$sumlm[[1]]
    ```


- If you want to extract the $R^2$, you can do this using map as well
  
    ```{r}
    sumdf$sumlm[[1]]$r.squared ## only gets one R^2 out.
    
    ## Gets all R^2 out
    sumdf |>
      mutate(rsquared = map_dbl(sumlm, "r.squared")) ->
      sumdf

    sumdf$rsquared
    ```
  
  
- **Exercise**: A [$t$-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test)
  is used to test for differences in population means. R implements this
  with `t.test()`. For example, if I want to test for differences between
  the mean `mpg`'s of automatics and manuals (coded in variable `am`), I would
  use the following syntax.
  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    t.test(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)$p.value
    ```
    
    Use `map()` to get the $p$-value for this test within each group of `cyl`.
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    mtcars |>
      nest(.by = cyl) |>
      mutate(tout = map(data, \(df) t.test(mpg ~ am, data = df))) |>
      mutate(pvalue = map_dbl(tout, "p.value"))
    ```

## `keep()` and `discard()`.

- `keep()` selects all variables that return `TRUE` according to some function.

- E.g. let's keep all numeric variables and calculate their means in the `palmerpenguins::penguins`
  data frame.

    ```{r}
    library(palmerpenguins)
    data("penguins")
    penguins |>
      keep(is.numeric) |>
      map_dbl(mean, na.rm = TRUE)
    ```
    
- `discard()` will select all variables that return `FALSE` according to some
  function.
  
- Let's count the number of each value for each categorical variable:

    ```{r}
    penguins |>
      discard(is.numeric) |>
      map(table)
    ```

- Other less useful functions are available in Section 21.9 of 
  [RDS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).


- **Exercise**: In the `mtcars` data frame, keep only variables that have a
  mean greater than `10` and calculate their mean. Hint: You'll have to use
  some of the shortcuts above.
  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    mtcars |>
      keep(~mean(.) > 10) |>
      map(mean)
    ```
