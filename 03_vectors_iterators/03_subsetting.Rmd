# Subsetting an Atomic Vector

- **Subsetting** is extracting elements from an object.
    - Subset because you only want some elements of a vector.
    - Subset so you can assign new elements to that subset.
    
- Six ways to subset atomic vector.

    ```{r}
    x <- c(8, 1.2, 33, 14)
    ```


1. **Integer Subsetting**:
    - Put integers in brackets and it will extract those elements. R starts counting at 1.
        ```{r}
        x[1]
        x[c(1, 3)]
        iset <- c(1, 3)
        x[iset]
        ```
    - This can be used for sorting
        ```{r}
        order(x)
        x[order(x)]
        ```
    - You can use duplicate integers to extract elements more than once.
        ```{r}
        x[c(2, 2, 2)]
        ```
2. **Negative Integer Subsetting**:
    - Putting negative integers in instead will return all elements except the negative elements.
        ```{r}
        x[-1]
        x[c(-1, -3)]
        x[-c(1, 3)]
        ```
3. **Logical Vector Subsetting**: 
    - Wherever there is a `TRUE` will return the element.
        ```{r}
        x[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)]
        ```

4. **No Subsetting**:
    - Empty brackets will return the original object.
        ```{r}
        x[]
        ```

5. **Zero Subsetting**:
    - Using `0` in a bracket will return a zero-length vector.
        ```{r}
        x[0]
        ```

6. **Names Subsetting**:
    - If a vector has names, then you can subset using those names in quotes.
        ```{r}
        names(x) <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
        x["a"]
        x[c("a", "c")]
        x[c("a", "a")]
        ```
    - If you know what names you want to remove, use `setdiff()`.
        ```{r}
        setdiff(names(x), "a")
        x[setdiff(names(x), "a")]
        ```

- **Exercise**: Explain the output of the following
    ```{r}
    y <- 1:9
    y[c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)]
    y[TRUE]
    y[FALSE]
    ```

    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    R will recycle the logical values.
    ```

- **Exercise**: Explain the output of the following
    ```{r}
    y <- c(1, 2)
    y[c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)]
    ```
    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    R assumes that all values after the second are NA.
    ```

- **Exercise**: Show all the ways to extract the second element of the following vector:
    ```{r}
    y <- c(af = 3, bd = 6, dd = 2)
    ```
    ```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    y[2]
    y[c(-1, -3)]
    y[c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)]
    y["bd"]
    ```

- Double brackets enforces that you are only extracting one element. This is really good in places where you know that you should only subset one element (like for-loops).

    ```{r}
    x <- runif(100)
    sval <- 0
    for (i in seq_along(x)) {
      sval <- sval + x[[i]]
    }
    ```

- Double brackets remove attributes of the vector (even names).

    ```{r}
    x <- c(a = 1, b = 2)
    x[1]
    x[[1]]
    ```

# List subsetting

- If you subset a list using single brackets, you will get a sublist. You can use integers, negative integers, logicals, and names as before

    ```{r}
    x <- list(a = 1:3, b = "hello", c = 4:6)
    str(x)
    
    x[1]
    x[c(1, 3)]
    x[-1]
    x[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)]
    x["a"]
    x[c("a", "c")]
    ```

- Using double brackets extracts out a single element.

    ```{r}
    x[[1]]
    x[["a"]]
    ```
    
- A shorthand for using names inside double brackets is to use dollar signs.

    ```{r}
    x$a
    ```

- **Exericse**: Why does this not work. Suggest a correction.

    ```{r}
    var <- "a"
    x$var
    ```

    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    `var` is not a name in `x`. Instead, use `x[[var]]`.
    ```

# Data Frame Subsetting

- Data frame subsetting behaves both like lists and like matrices.

    ```{r}
    df <- data.frame(a = 1:3,
                     b = c("a", "b", "c"),
                     c = 4:6)
    ```

- It behaves like a list for `$`, `[[`, and `[` if you only provide one index. The columns are the elements of the list.

    ```{r}
    df$a
    df[1]
    df[[1]]
    df[c(1, 3)]
    ```

- It behaves like a matrix if you provide two indices.

    ```{r}
    df[1:2, 2]
    ```

- You can keep the data frame structure by using `drop = FALSE`.

    ```{r}
    df[1:2, 2, drop = FALSE]
    ```

- It is common to filter by rows by using the matrix indexing.

    ```{r}
    df[df$a < 3, ]
    ```


# Hadley's Advanced R Exercises


1. Fix each of the following common data frame subsetting errors:
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    mtcars[mtcars$cyl = 4, ]
    mtcars[-1:4, ]
    mtcars[mtcars$cyl <= 5]
    mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4 | 6, ]
    ```
    
    ```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
    mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4, ]
    mtcars[-c(1:4), ]
    mtcars[mtcars$cyl <= 5, ]
    mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4 | mtcars$cyl == 6, ]
    ```
    

2. Why does the following code yield five missing values? (Hint: why is it different from `x[NA_real_]`?)
    ```{r}
    x <- 1:5
    x[NA]
    ```

    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    Recycling happens with logical indices. For integer indices, we just get `NA` since we are choosing a missing value index.
    ```

3. What does `upper.tri()` return? How does subsetting a matrix with it work?

    ```{r}
    x <- outer(1:5, 1:5, FUN = "*")
    x[upper.tri(x)]
    ```

    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    It returns a vector of `TRUE` and `FALSE` values, where a `TRUE` will be the location of an upper triangular elemetn of the matrix. When we use it in subsetting, we get all of the upper triangular elements of the matrix.
    ```

4. Why does `mtcars[1:20]` return an error? How does it differ from the similar `mtcars[1:20, ]`?

    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    There aren't 20 columns in `mtcars`. There are only 11.
    
    The second one will extract hte first 20 rows of `mtcars`.
    ```

5. An `lm` object is a list-like object. Given a linear model, e.g., `mod <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)`, extract the residual degrees of freedom. Then extract the R squared from the model summary (`summary(mod)`).

    ```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
    mod <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
    # str(mod)
    mod$df.residual
    sumval <- summary(mod)
    # str(sumval)
    sumval$r.squared
    ```

# Subassignment

- All subsetting operators can be used to assign subsets of a vector new values. This is called **subassignment**.

    ```{r}
    x <- 1:5
    x[[2]] <- 200
    x
    x[c(1, 3)] <- 0
    x
    x[x == 0] <- NA_real_
    x
    
    y <- list(a = 1:3,
              b = "hello",
              c = 4:6)
    y$a <- "no way"
    y
    ```

- Remove a list element with `NULL`.

    ```{r}
    y[[1]] <- NULL
    y
    y$b <- NULL
    y
    ```
    
# Exercises

These are just meant to buff up your Base R skills. Consider the data from the `{Sleuth3}` package that contains information on sex and salary at a bank. Try to use just base R methods.

```{r}
library(Sleuth3)
data("case0102")
sal <- case0102
```

1. What is the salary of the person in the 51st row? Use two different subsetting strategies to get this.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    sal$Salary[51]
    sal[51, 1]
    ```

2. What is the mean salary of Male's?

    ```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    mean(sal$Salary[sal$Sex == "Male"])
    ```

3. How many Females are in the data?
    ```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    sum(sal$Sex == "Female")
    ```

4. How many Females make over \$6000?

    ```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    sum(sal$Salary[sal$Sex == "Female"] > 6000)
    ```
