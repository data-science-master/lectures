# Learning Objectives

- Simple Linear Regression
- Chapter 8 of [OpenIntro Statistics (Fourth Edition)](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php)
- [Introduction to Broom](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/broom/vignettes/broom.html)

# Motivation
- The simple linear model is not sexy.
- But the most commonly used methods in Statistics are either
    [specific applications of it](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/)
    or are generalizations of it.
- Understanding it well will help you better understand methods
  taught in other classes.

# Broom

```{r}
library(broom)
```

- For the most popular model output, the `broom` package provides three
  functions that aid in data analysis.
    1. `tidy()`: Provides summary information of the model (such as parameter
       estimates and $p$-values) in a tidy format. We used this last class.
    2. `augment()`: Creates data derived from the model and adds it to the
       original data, such as residuals
       and fits. It formats this augmented data in a tidy format.
    3. `glance()`: Prints a single row summary of the model fit.
    
- These three functions are *very* useful and incorporate well with the 
  tidyverse.
  
- You will see examples of using these functions for the linear models below.

# `mtcars`

- For this section, we will use the (infamous) `mtcars` dataset that comes
  with R by default.
    ```{r, message=FALSE}
    library(tidyverse)
    data("mtcars")
    glimpse(mtcars)
    ```

- It's "infamous" because [every R class uses it](https://twitter.com/ZachDrakeTweets/status/1151549076992876551?s=20). 
  But it's a really nice dataset to showcase some statistical methods.
    
- The goal of this dataset is to determine which variables affect fuel 
  consumption (the `mpg` variable in the dataset).
  
- To begin, we'll look at the association between the variables log-weight 
  and mpg (more on why we used log-weight later).
  
    ```{r}
    ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, mpg)) +
      geom_point() +
      scale_x_log10() +
      xlab("Weight") +
      ylab("Miles Per Gallon")
    ```
    
- It seems that log-weight is negatively associated with mpg.    
    
- It seems that the data approximately fall on a line.

# Line Review
- Every line may be represented by a formula of the form
    $$
    Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X
    $$
- $Y$ = response variable on $y$-axis
- $X$ = explanatory variable on the $x$-axis
- $\beta_1$ = slope (rise over run)
    - How much larger is $Y$ when $X$ is increased by 1.
- $\beta_0$ = $y$-intercept (the value of the line at $X = 0$)

- You can represent any line in terms of its slope and its $y$-intercept:

    ![](./cartoons/line_review.png)\ 
    
- If $\beta_1 < 0$ then the line slopes downward. If $\beta_1 > 0$ then the 
  line slopes upword. If $\beta_1 = 0$ then the line is horizontal.
    
- **Exercise**: Suppose we consider the line defined by the following equation:
  $$
  Y = 2 + 4X
  $$
  - What is the value of $Y$ at $X = 3$?
  - What is the value of $Y$ at $X = 4$?
  - What is the difference in $Y$ values at $X = 3$ versus $X = 4$?
  - What is the value of $Y$ at $X = 0$?

# Simple Linear Regression Model

- A line does not *exactly* fit the `mtcars` dataset. But a line does
  *approximate* the `mtcars` data.
  
- Model: Response variable = line + noise.
    $$
    Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i
    $$

- We typically assume that the noise ($\epsilon_i$'s) for each individual has 
  mean 0 and some variance $\sigma^2$. We estimate $\sigma^2$.

- *Given* $X_i$, mean of $Y_i$ is $\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i$. Points vary
   about this mean.
   
    ![](./cartoons/reg1.png)\    
    
- Some intuition:
  - The distribution of $Y$ is *conditional* on the value of $X$.
  - The distribution of $Y$ is assumed to have the **same variance**, 
    $\sigma^2$ for **all possible values of $X$**.
  - This last one is a considerable assumption.
  
- Interpretation:
  - Randomized Experiment: A 1 unit increase in $x$ results in a $\beta_1$ unit
    increase in $y$.
  - Observational Study: Individuals that differ only in 1 unit of $x$ are
    expected to differ by $\beta_1$ units of $y$.

- **Exercise**: What is the interpretation of $\beta_0$? 
  
# Estimating Coefficients
- How do we estimate $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$?
  - $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are **parameters**
  - We want to estimate them from our **sample**\pause
  - Idea: Draw a line through the cloud of points and calculate the slope 
    and intercept of that line?
  - Problem: Subjective\pause
  - Another idea: Minimize residuals (sum of squared residuals).

- Ordinary Least Squares
  - Residuals: $\hat{\epsilon}_i = Y_{i} - (\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1X_i)$
  - Sum of squared residuals: $\hat{\epsilon}_1^2 + \hat{\epsilon}_2^2 + \cdots + \hat{\epsilon}_n^2$
  - Find $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$ that have small sum of squared residuals.
  - The obtained estimates, $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$, are called
    the **ordinary least squares** (OLS) estimates.
    
- Bad Fit:
    ```{r, echo=FALSE}
    mtcars %>%
      select(mpg, wt) %>%
      mutate(logwt = log(wt)) ->
      submt
    beta0 <- 37
    beta1 <- -10
    submt$fitted <- beta0 + submt$logwt * beta1
    ss <- sum((submt$fitted - submt$mpg)^2)
    submt %>%
      ggplot(mapping = aes(x = logwt, y = mpg)) +
      geom_point() +
      geom_abline(slope = beta1, intercept = beta0, color = "blue", alpha = 1/2) +
      xlab("Log-Weight") + 
      ylab("MPG") +
      geom_segment(mapping = aes(x = logwt, xend = logwt, y = mpg, yend = fitted), alpha = 1/2) +
      ggtitle(paste0("Sum of Squares: ", round(ss, digits = 2)))
    ```
    
- Better Fit:
    ```{r, echo=FALSE}
    beta0 <- 38
    beta1 <- -14
    submt$fitted <- beta0 + submt$logwt * beta1
    ss <- sum((submt$fitted - submt$mpg)^2)
    submt %>%
      ggplot(mapping = aes(x = logwt, y = mpg)) +
      geom_point() +
      geom_abline(slope = beta1, intercept = beta0, color = "blue", alpha = 1/2) +
      xlab("Log-Weight") + 
      ylab("MPG") +
      geom_segment(mapping = aes(x = logwt, xend = logwt, y = mpg, yend = fitted), alpha = 1/2) +
      ggtitle(paste0("Sum of Squares: ", round(ss, digits = 2)))
    ```
    
- Best Fit (OLS Fit):
    ```{r, echo=FALSE}
    lmout <- lm(mpg ~ logwt, data = submt)
    beta0 <- coef(lmout)[1]
    beta1 <- coef(lmout)[2]
    submt$fitted <- beta0 + submt$logwt * beta1
    ss <- sum((submt$fitted - submt$mpg)^2)
    submt %>%
      ggplot(mapping = aes(x = logwt, y = mpg)) +
      geom_point() +
      geom_abline(slope = beta1, intercept = beta0, color = "blue", alpha = 1/2) +
      xlab("Log-Weight") + 
      ylab("MPG") +
      geom_segment(mapping = aes(x = logwt, xend = logwt, y = mpg, yend = fitted), alpha = 1/2) +
      ggtitle(paste0("Sum of Squares: ", round(ss, digits = 2)))
    ```

- How to find OLS fits in R:
    ```{r}
    lmout <- lm(mpg ~ log(wt), data = mtcars)
    lmtide <- tidy(lmout)
    select(lmtide, term, estimate)
    ```

- The first argument in `lm()` is a **formula**, where the response variable
  is to the left of the tilde and the explanatory variable is to the right of
  the tilde. 
  
    ``` r
    response ~ explanatory
    ```
    
    This formula says that `lm()` should find the OLS estimates of the 
    following model: 
    
    response = $\beta_0$ + $\beta_1$explanatory + noise
  
- The `data` argument tells `lm()` where to find the response and 
  explanatory variables.

- We often put a "hat" over the coefficient names to denote that they are estimates:
  - $\hat{\beta}_0$ = `r round(lmtide$estimate[1], digits = 1)`.
  - $\hat{\beta}_1$ = `r round(lmtide$estimate[2], digits = 1)`.
  
- Thus, the estimated line is:
  - $E[Y_i]$ = `r round(lmtide$estimate[1], digits = 1)` + 
    `r round(lmtide$estimate[2], digits = 1)`$X_i$.

## Hypothesis Testing

- The sign of $\beta_1$ denotes different types of relationships between
  the two quantitative variables:
    - $\beta_1 = 0$: The two quantitative variables are not linearly associated.
    - $\beta_1 > 0$: The two quantitative variables are positively associated.
    - $\beta_1 < 0$: The two quantitative variables are negatively associated.
    
- Hypothesis Testing:
  - We are often interested in testing if a relationship exists:
  - Two possibilities: 
    1. Alternative Hypothesis: $\beta_1 \neq 0$.
    2. Null Hypothesis: $\beta_1 = 0$.
  - Strategy: We calculate the probability of the data assuming possibility 2 
    (called a $p$-value). If this probability is low, we conclude possibility 1. 
    If the this probability is high, we don’t conclude anything.

- The distribution of $\hat{\beta}_1$ comes from statistical theory. The 
  $t$-statistic is $\hat{\beta}_1 / SE(\hat{\beta}_1)$. It has 
  a $t$-distribution with $n-2$ degrees of freedom.

- $SE(\hat{\beta}_1)$: Estimated standard deviation of the sampling distribution
  of $\hat{\beta}_1$.
  
- The confidence intervals for $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are easy to obtain 
  from the output of `tidy()` if you set `conf.int = TRUE`.
  
    ```{r}
    lmtide <- tidy(lmout, conf.int = TRUE)
    select(lmtide, conf.low, conf.high)
    ```
    
- **Exercise** (8.18 in OpenIntro 4th Edition): Which is higher? Determine if (i) 
  or (ii) is higher or if they are equal. Explain your reasoning. For a
  regression line, the uncertainty associated with the slope estimate, 
  $\hat{\beta}_1$ , is higher when
    i. there is a lot of scatter around the regression line or
    ii. there is very little scatter around the regression line
        
    ```{block, echo = FALSE}
    (i). If there is a lot of scatter, then it is hard to pin-point the mean
    relationship. This can be formalized by looking at the contribution of the
    sample size in the standard error formula for $\hat{\beta}_1$.
    ```
    
    
- **Exercise**: Load in the `bac` dataset from the openintro R package.
  1. Create an appropriate plot to visualize the association between the number
     of beers and the BAC.
    ```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
    library(openintro)
    data("bac")
    ggplot(bac, aes(x = Beers, y = BAC)) +
      geom_point()
    ```
  2. Does the relationship appear positive or negative?
    ```{block, echo = FALSE}
    Positive. It points up.
    ```
  3. Write out equation of the OLS line.
    ```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
    lmout <- lm(BAC ~ Beers, data = bac)
    tdat <- tidy(lmout, conf.int = TRUE)
    beta0hat <- tdat$estimate[1]
    beta1hat <- tdat$estimate[2]
    ```
    ```{block, echo = FALSE}
    y = `r beta0hat` + `r beta1hat` x
    ```
  4. Do we have evidence that the number of beers is associated with BAC? 
     Formally justify.
    ```{block, echo=FALSE}
    Yes, the $p$-value is `r tdat$p.value[2]`, which provides strong
    evidence against the null that the two variables are not linearly
    associated.
    ```
  5. Interpret the coefficient estimates.
    ```{block, echo=FALSE}
    Every beer a person drinks is expected to increase their blood alcohol
    content by 0.018. I use causal language here because this was a randomized
    experiment.
    
    The BAC at zero beers is expected to be -0.0127.
    ```
  6. What happens to the standard errors of the estimates when we force
     the interecept to be 0? Why?
    ```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
    lmout2 <- lm(BAC ~ Beers - 1, data = bac)
    tdat2 <- tidy(lmout2, conf.int = TRUE)
    tdat$std.error[2]
    tdat2$std.error
    ```
    ```{block, echo=FALSE}
    It shrinks. That's because we are having to estimate one less parameter
    and so we have degrees of freedom.
    ```
