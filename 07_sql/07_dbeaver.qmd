# Learning Objectives

- Using the [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) IDE.
- DuckDB tutorial on DBeaver: <https://duckdb.org/docs/guides/sql_editors/dbeaver>

# Motivation

- No job will have you use R Studio to do SQL.

- Let's try out another IDE.

# Setup

- The instructions here are only for DuckDB. But DBeaver works with other DBMS's pretty easily.

- Download and install DBeaver Community here: <https://dbeaver.io/download/>

-   When you open it up, select "DuckDB"

    ```{r, out.width="75%", echo=FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics(path = "./figs/dbeaver_01_duckdb.png")
    ```


-   With "Host" selected, navigate to your `flights.duckdb` database. Click "Finish".

    ```{r, out.width="75%", echo=FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics(path = "./figs/dbeaver_02_path.png")
    ```
    
-   Click on the database name "flights.duckdb" in the top right. If you haven't used it before, it will ask you to install a driver to use connect to a DuckDB database.

    ```{r, out.width="75%", echo=FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics(path = "./figs/dbeaver_03_install.png")
    ```


-   You should now see the database. Right click on the connection and create a new SQL file.

    ```{r, out.width="75%", echo=FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics(path = "./figs/dbeaver_04_sqlfile.png")
    ```

-   Type some SQL and hit the execute button ![](./figs/dbeaver_execute.png)\ or just hit Control/Command + Enter.

    ```{r, out.width="75%", echo=FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics(path = "./figs/dbeaver_05_execute.png")
    ```


- You can now play around with SQL. When you want to save the data to a CSV file, just hit "Export data".

- There are a lot of features in DBeaver, but we won't cover them. They are pretty intuitive. Just play with it for awhile.

# Exercises

Use DBeaver for all of these exercises.

1.  What is the mean temperature for flights from each airport?

    ```{sql, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    SELECT "origin", AVG("temp") AS "temp"
    FROM weather 
    GROUP BY "origin";
    ```

2.  What is the average number of flights from each airport per day in January?

    ```{sql, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    SELECT "origin", COUNT() / 31.0 AS "ave"
    FROM flights 
    WHERE "month" = 1
    GROUP BY "origin";
    ```

3.  What are the top destinations for each airport?

    ```{sql, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    SELECT "origin", "dest", "n"
    FROM
    (
    SELECT "origin", "dest", "n", MAX("n") OVER (PARTITION BY "origin") AS "nmax"
    FROM
    (
    SELECT "origin", "dest", COUNT() AS "n",
    FROM flights
    GROUP BY "origin", "dest"
    )
    )
    WHERE "n" = "nmax"
    ```
