# Learning Objectives

- Kanban system for project management

# Kanban

- There are many project management paradigms out there.

- We will focus on one that is popular in software engineering and adapt it to data science: kanban.

- Other systems (like scrum) are too focused on deliverables, whereas in data science outcomes are typically uncertain.

  - E.g., sometimes the questions you have are impossible to answer given the data available.

- Kanban is also natively supported in GitHub repos.

- Kanban is a board with (at least) three columns: "To do" or "Backlog", "In progress", and "Done".
