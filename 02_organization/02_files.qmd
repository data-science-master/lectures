# Learning Objectives

- Understand file systems on Windows and Mac.
- Better organize your files.

# Overview

- Your computer organizes files using a **hierarchical directory structure**.

- This structure follows a tree-like pattern of **directories**, called **folders** on Windows and Mac.

- **Folders** contain **files** and other folders, called **subfolders** or **subdirectories**.

- The top-level directory is called the **root**.

- The **root** contains all files and directories on your computer.

- Your **home** directory is the default location for your files. 
  - On a Mac, this is typically `Users/your_username`, but it may differ.
  - On Windows, this is typically `C:\Users\your_username`, but it may differ.
  
- Note that Mac (and other Linux varieties) uses forward slashes, while Windows uses back slashes. This is not something you have to worry about most of the time.
  - Git Bash for Windows uses forward slashes.
  - You can (should) always use forward slashes in R, even on Windows machines.

- The home directory is also the working directory of your shell when you first open it.

- You use a [**file management program**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_manager) to navigate and manage your files:

  - On Windows: **File Explorer**
  - On Mac: **Finder**
  
- There are tons of [alternatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_managers) if you are curious.

- You should know how to perform the following tasks using your file management system. If you do not know how to do **any** of them, come talk to me:

  - Navigate to your home directory.
  - Navigate to your Documents folder.
  - Navigate to your AU OneDrive.
  - Create a new folder.
  - Move a file from one folder to another.
  - Copy a file and paste it in another folder.
  - Rename a file or folder.
  
- I won't cover how to do them in these notes because even different versions of the same operating system have slightly different workflows.

- To add the home directory to your sidebar on Mac for quick access:
  - Finder -> Settings -> "Show these items in the sidebar" -> Check your username (with the home icon).

# File/Folder Naming

- **Do not use spaces**. Use underscores (`_`) instead (hyphons are also very common)
  - Spaces make command-line scripts more annoying to code up.
  
- **Do not use periods**.
  - These should be reserved for file extensions.
  
- **Do not use other special characters** like back slashes or dollar signs or quotes
  - These can make it harder for the machine to read the files.
  
- **Do not depend on case** to differentiate files.
  - Some file systems are case sensitive, but others are not. So if you depend on case (e.g., "File.txt" vs "file.txt"), then you are setting yourself up for a headache.
  - I typically just use lower_snake_case for all files/folders except top level folders (like "Documents" or "Downloads" or "Desktop" etc)
  
- **DO** use numbers to help with default ordering for files.
  - E.g. Suppose "intro.R" was done before "basics.R". To respect that order, name it "01_intro.R" and "02_basics.R".
  
- **Exercise** (From R for data science): Rename these files (I've added context to help you)
  - "alternative model.R": Second modeling approach
  - "code for exploratory analysis.r"
  - "finalreport.qmd": Done on March 20, 2022
  - "FinalReport.qmd": Done on April 2, 2022
  - "fig 1.png"
  - "Figure_02.png"
  - "model_first_try.R": First modeling approach
  - "run-first.r": Loads the data
  - "temp.txt": Notes for the final report

```{text, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
This is one way:
- "01_load_data.R"
- "02_exploratory_analysis.R"
- "03_model_approach_1.R"
- "04_model_approach_2.R"
- "fig_01.png"
- "fig_02.png"
- "report_2022_03_20.qmd"
- "report_2022_04_02.qmd"
- "report_draft_notes.txt"
```


# File Organization

- Because your file system is hierarchical, your file organization should take advantage of that structure.

- **Bad example**: Placing all of your files directly on the Desktop or at the same folder level.
  - This is more common than you might think, but it makes files hard to manage.

- There are many good ways to organize your files. Here's one recommended structure:

  - In your home directory, create a folder called `Courses`.

  - Inside `Courses`, create a folder for each course (e.g., `data_412`, `data_413`).

  - Within each course folder, include `homeworks` and `notes` folders.

  - Inside the `homeworks` folder, create one folder per assignment (e.g., `hw_01`, `hw_02`, etc.).

  - Inside the `notes` folder, create one folder per topic (e.g., `01_bash`, `02_git`, etc.).

  - Place your work in the appropriate subfolders.

  - Add other subfolders as needed (e.g., `final_project`).

- Visualization:

  <img src="./02_figs/file_hier.png" alt="Recommended directory hierarchy" width="70%"/>

- Using numbers for the folder names in this way makes sure they are ordered the same way as the order of discussion.

- **Exercise**:
  1. Create a "Courses" directory in your home directory.
  2. Create a "data_413" or "data_613" directory in your "Courses" directory.
  3. Create "homeworks" and "notes" directories in your "data_413" or "data_613" directory.
  4. Transfer your current notes for this class from wherever they are to your new directories. Make sure they are named well (no spaces, numbered ordering, etc).
  
# Some file things you might not know

## File extensions

- A file extension is a suffix for a file (like ".txt", ".jpg", ".R", etc). It is primarily used to tell the operating system what program to use to open it.

- When you double click on a file, your operating system knows what program to use (almost) only because of the file extension.

- Windows sometimes hides the file extension. You should change the settings so you can see them:
  - Open File Explorer, click on the "View" tab, and check the "File name extensions" box.

- There are ways to choose the default program to use when opening a file with a given file extension.

## Hidden files

- Some files/folders are hidden by default. These typically begin with a period "`.`".

- Common examples:
  - `.git`: A folder that contains all of your version history.
  - `.gitignore`: A file that you can edit to say what files to never commit.
  - `.DS_Store`: A Mac-specific file used by Finder to maintain properties of your folder.
  - `.Renviron`: A file you can create that contains variables (format: `name=value`) that are available on startup.
  - `.Rprofile`: A file you can create that is sourced on R's startup. Can be any R code.
  
- There are ways to see hidden files by default.
