# Learning Objectives

- Understand file systems on Windows and Mac.

# Overview

- Your computer organizes files using a **hierarchical directory structure**.

- This structure follows a tree-like pattern of **directories**—called **folders** on Windows and Mac.

- **Folders** contain **files** and other folders, called **subfolders** or **subdirectories**.

- The top-level directory is called the **root**.

- The **root** contains all files and directories on your computer.

- Your **home** directory is the default location for your files. On a Mac, this is typically `Users/your_username`, but it may differ.

  - It’s also the working directory of your shell when you first open it.

- You use a [**file management program**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_manager) to navigate and manage your files:

  - On Windows: **File Explorer**
  - On Mac: **Finder**
  
- There are tons of [alternatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_managers) if you are curious.

- You should know how to perform the following tasks using your file management system. If you do not know how to do **any** of them, come talk to me:

  - Navigate to your home directory.
  - Navigate to your Documents folder.
  - Navigate to your AU OneDrive.
  - Create a new folder.
  - Move a file from one folder to another.
  - Copy a file and paste it in another folder.
  - Rename a file or folder.
  
- I won't cover how to do them in these notes because even different versions of the same operating system have slightly different workflows.

- To add the home directory to your sidebar on Mac for quick access:
  - Finder → Settings → “Show these items in the sidebar” → Check your username (with the home icon).

- When naming files or folders, **do not use spaces**. Use underscores (`_`) instead.

# File Organization

- Because your file system is hierarchical, your file organization should take advantage of that structure.

- **Bad example**: Placing all of your files directly on the Desktop or at the same folder level.
  - You’d be surprised how often I see this on student computers.

- There are many good ways to organize your files. Here’s one recommended structure:

  - In your home directory, create a folder called `Courses`.

  - Inside `Courses`, create a folder for each course (e.g., `data_412`, `data_413`).

  - Within each course folder, include `homeworks` and `notes` folders.

  - Inside the `homeworks` folder, create one folder per assignment (e.g., `hw_01`, `hw_02`, etc.).

  - Inside the `notes` folder, create one folder per topic (e.g., `01_bash`, `02_git`, etc.).

  - Place your work in the appropriate subfolders.

  - Add other subfolders as needed (e.g., `final_project`).

- Visualization:

  <img src="./02_figs/file_hier.png" alt="Recommended directory hierarchy" width="70%"/>

- Using numbers for the folder names in this way makes sure they are ordered the same way as the order of discussion.

- **Exercise**:
  1. Create a "Courses" directory in your home directory.
  2. Create a "data_413" or "data_613" directory in your "Courses" directory.
  3. Create "homeworks" and "notes" directories in your "data_413" or "data_613" directory.
  4. Transfer your current notes for this class from wherever they are to your new directories. Make sure they are named well (no spaces, numbered ordering, etc).
